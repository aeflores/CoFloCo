The abstract representation is a set of cost equations that can be generated from source code, bytecode or\r\nother intermediate representations.\r\n\r\nThe main techniques used in CoFloCo are described in the paper:\r\n * [Antonio Flores-Montoya, Reiner HÃ¤hnle: Resource Analysis of Complex Programs with Cost Equations. APLAS 2014: 275-295](https://www.se.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_SE/Page_Content/Group_Members/Antonio_Flores-Montoya/APLAS14techReport.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Using Vagrant\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can use CoFloCo without installing any of the dependencies using \r\n[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).  Vagrant will start a\r\nLinux virtual machine and install the needed dependencies.  In the\r\n`CoFloCo/` directory, run the command `vagrant up` to provision and\r\nstart a VM, then `vagrant ssh` to connect.\r\n\r\nWithin the VM, this directory is accessible in the directory `/vagrant`.\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n * Linux or Mac: In principle it should be possible to use CoFloCo in Windows but it might require some slight changes.\r\n   \r\n * [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/):  CoFloCo works with Version 6.6.6\r\n     \r\n     \r\n * [GMP](https://gmplib.org/): The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (It is required by SWI-Prolog)\r\n     \r\n     \r\n * [Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL)](http://bugseng.com/products/ppl): CoFloCo uses the latest version available at the moment (1.1)  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Complete Installation\r\n\r\n * Install SWI-Prolog 6.6.6 and the GMP library\r\n \r\n * CoFloCo requires the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) with the SWI-Prolog interface installed.\r\n   The distributions that are available with apt-get (linux) or port (mac) do not include the SWI-prolog\r\n   interface at the moment.\r\n\r\n   For convenience, we included a binary of PPL for Linux x64  in  `src/lib/`. If you have this system,\r\n   you can avoid compiling and installing the library. \r\n   Just make sure the make sure the libraries are found by cofloco before you execute it:\r\n    \r\n     `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./src/lib/`\r\n   \r\n   If you want to use your own installation of PPL (say you have a mac), you can download the sources from\r\n   the official page http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download.\r\n   In the directory of ppl execute:\r\n   \r\n      `./configure --enable-interfaces=swi_prolog`\r\n\r\n      `make`\r\n\r\n      `sudo make install`\r\n   \r\n\tSome extra options might be necessary depending on your system. PPL provides documentation\r\n\ton how to configure and compile in different systems.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n * Once installed all the requirements, you can call CoFloCo with the script \"cofloco\" in the main directory: \r\n   \r\n     `./cofloco -i examples/EXAMPLE_FILE`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage information\r\n\r\n  See the file `./USAGE` for a description of the parameters, input format, explanation of the outputs, etc.\r\n  \r\n## Files:\r\n\r\n  * `examples/`: Example input files\r\n      - `examples/evaluation/` : A set of examples used in the evaluation of the tool\r\n      - `examples/testing/` :Small examples to exercise different functionalities of the tool.\r\n  * `src/`: Source files of CoFloCo\r\n      - `src/main_cofloco.pl`: The main module\r\n      - ...\r\n  * `cofloco`: main script for executing CoFloCo\r\n  * `README`: this file\r\n  * `USAGE`: basic instructions of how to use CoFloCo\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Contact:\r\n\r\n   antoniofloresmontoya@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## Contributors:\r\n\r\n   * Antonio Flores-Montoya\r\n   \r\n## Credits:\r\n\r\nCoFloCo uses the stdlib created by the costa team (http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/)\r\nand was in part inspired by PUBS http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/pubs/pubs.php.\r\n\r\nCoFloCo is funded by the EU project FP7-ICT-610582 ENVISAGE: Engineering Virtualized Services \r\n   http://www.envisage-project.eu\r\n   \r\n","google":"UA-69257705-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
