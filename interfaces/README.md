This folder contains different interfaces to transform programs expressed in different languages into cost relations that can be solved by CoFloCo.

* _Lisp2ces_ transforms a restricted form of Lisp programs into cost relations.

* _C2ces_ tranforms integer transition systems generated by [llvm2kittel](https://github.com/s-falke/llvm2kittel) (originated from C programs) into cost relations.
