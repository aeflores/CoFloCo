Description:
--------------
CoFloCo is a static analysis tool to infer automatically symbolic complexity bounds of imperative and recursive programs.
CoFloCo's analysis is not binded to any specific programming language, instead it takes an abstract representation of programs
as an input. The abstract representation is a set of cost equations that can be generated from source code, bytecode or
other intermediate representations.

The main techniques used in CoFloCo are described in the paper:
 * Antonio Flores-Montoya, Reiner HÃ¤hnle: Resource Analysis of Complex Programs with Cost Equations. APLAS 2014: 275-295

Besides, the code is reasonably documented using pldoc (http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/pldoc.html)

Requirements:
--------------
 * Linux: In principle it should be possible to use CoFloCo in Windows or Mac but it might require some slight changes.
   
 * SWI-Prolog:  CoFloCo works with Version 6.6.6
     http://www.swi-prolog.org/
     
 * GMP: The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (It is required by SWI-Prolog)
     https://gmplib.org/
     
 * Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL): CoFloCo uses the latest version available at the moment (1.1)  
     http://bugseng.com/products/ppl

Installation
--------------
 * Install SWI-Prolog 6.6.6 and the GMP library
 
 * CoFloCo requires the Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) with the SWI-Prolog interface installed.
   For convenience, we included a binary of PPL for Linux x64  in  src/lib/. If you have this system,
   you can avoid installing the library. 
   Just make sure the make sure the libraries are found by cofloco:
    
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./src/lib/
   
   If you want to use your own installation of PPL, you can follow the instructions
   in the official page http://bugseng.com/products/ppl/download.
   
 * Once installed all the requirements, you can call CoFloCo with the script "cofloco" in the main directory: 
   
     ./cofloco -i examples/EXAMPLE_FILE
