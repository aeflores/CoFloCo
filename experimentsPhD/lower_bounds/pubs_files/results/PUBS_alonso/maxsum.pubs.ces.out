Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/MaxSumSubArray_choose(Lamor/atva/Rec;Lamor/atva/Rec;Lamor/atva/Rec;)Lamor/atva/Rec;'(A,B,C) is 21.

Lower Bound of '29_loop'(A,B,C,D,E,F,G) is 15*nat(B-G)+3.

Lower Bound of 'java/lang/Object_<init>()V'(A) is 1.

Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/Rec_<init>(IID)V'(A,B,C,D,E) is 13.

Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/MaxSumSubArray_cross([DIII)Lamor/atva/Rec;'(A,B,C,D) is c(failed(schemes_failed,[scc=1,cr='26_loop'/7]))+ (15*nat(-C+D)+43).

Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/MaxSumSubArray_maxsum([D)Lamor/atva/Rec;'(A) is log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*c(failed(schemes_failed,[scc=1,cr='26_loop'/7]))+15*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*nat(A/2+1/2)+ (103*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)+48).

Computed Lower Bound is log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*c(failed(schemes_failed,[scc=1,cr='26_loop'/7]))+15*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*nat(A/2+1/2)+ (103*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)+48).
