Lower Bound of '13_loop'(A,B,C,D) is 11*nat(C-D+1)+3.

Lower Bound of '16_loop'(A,B,C,C,D,D,E) is 22*nat(C-D+1)+3.

Lower Bound of '17_loop'(A,B,C,D,E) is 12*nat(C-D+1)+3.

Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/MergeSort_merge([C[CIII)V'(A,B,C,D,E) is 12*c(minimize_failed)+20.

Lower Bound of 'amor/atva/MergeSort_msort([C)V'(A) is 12*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*c(minimize_failed)+ (50*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)+19).

Computed Lower Bound is 12*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)*c(minimize_failed)+ (50*log(2,nat(2*A-3)+1)+19).
