Lower Bound of '12_loop'(A,B,C,D,E) is nat(C-D+1).

Lower Bound of '12'(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I) is nat(D-F+1).

Lower Bound of '38_normal'(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J) is nat(-C+D+1).

Lower Bound of '9_loop'(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) is nat(C-E+1).

Lower Bound of '9'(A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I) is nat(D-F+1)+nat(-C+D+1).

Lower Bound of 'testing/recursion/ms_merge([IIII)V'(A,B,C,D,E) is 2*nat(-C+D+1).

Lower Bound of '29_normal'(A,B,C,D,E,F) is 2*nat(-C+D+1).

Computed Lower Bound is 2*log(2,nat(-2*C+2*D-1)+1)*nat(-C+D+1).
