Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive : [m1/0]
1. non_recursive : [m2/0]
2. non_recursive : [m3/1]
3. recursive : [hanoi/1,m0/1,m4/1,m5/1,m6/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is partially evaluated into hanoi/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations hanoi/1 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations hanoi/1 
* CE 4: hanoi(A) = 17+ hanoi(B)+ hanoi(B)
     [B>=0,B+1=A] 
* CE 5: hanoi(A) = 3
     [A=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of hanoi/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of hanoi/1 
* Loop 3: hanoi(A) [A=0] 
* Loop 4: hanoi(A)->  hanoi(A')  hanoi(A')
                  [A'>=0,A'+1=A] 

### Ranking functions of CR hanoi(A) 
* RF of phase [4]: [A]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR hanoi(A) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1,4:2]:
    A


### Resulting Chains:hanoi(A) 
* [3]
* [multiple([4],[[3]])]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:hanoi(A) -> [hanoi(A'),hanoi(A'2)] 
17
#### Cost of phase [4]:hanoi(A) -> [] 
17*it(4)+3*it([3])+0
#### Cost of chains of hanoi(A):
* Chain [3]: 3
  with precondition: [A=0] 

* Chain [multiple([4],[[3]])]: 17*it(4)+3*it([3])+0
  with precondition: [A>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of hanoi(A): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [3] with precondition: [A=0] 
    - Lower bound: 3 
    - Complexity: constant
 * Chain [multiple([4],[[3]])] with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Lower bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant
 
### Partitioned lower bound of hanoi(A): 
* 0 
 if [A>=1]
* 3 
 if [A=0]
Possible lower bounds : [0,3]
Maximum lower bound complexity: constant
