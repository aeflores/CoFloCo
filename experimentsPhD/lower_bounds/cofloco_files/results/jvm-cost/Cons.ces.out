Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations cons/1 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations cons/1 
* CE 4: cons(A) = 22+ cons(B)
     [A>=B+1,B>=1] 
* CE 5: cons(A) = 24
     [A>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of cons/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of cons/1 
* Loop 3: cons(A) [A>=1] 
* Loop 4: cons(A)->  cons(A')
                  [A>=A'+1,A'>=1] 

### Ranking functions of CR cons(A) 
* RF of phase [4]: [A-1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR cons(A) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    A-1


### Resulting Chains:cons(A) 
* [[4],3]
* [3]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:cons(A) -> [cons(A')] 
22
#### Cost of phase [4]:cons(A) -> [cons(A')] 
22*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< A-1
it(4) =< A-A'

#### Cost of chains of cons(A):
* Chain [[4],3]: 22*it(4)+24
  Such that:it(4) =< A-1

  with precondition: [A>=2] 

* Chain [3]: 24
  with precondition: [A>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of cons(A): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [[4],3] with precondition: [A>=2] 
    - Lower bound: 24 
    - Complexity: constant
 * Chain [3] with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Lower bound: 24 
    - Complexity: constant
 
### Partitioned lower bound of cons(A): 
* 24 
 if [A>=1]
Possible lower bounds : [24]
