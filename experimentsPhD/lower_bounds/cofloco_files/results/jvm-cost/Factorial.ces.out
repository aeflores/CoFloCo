Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive : [m1/0]
1. non_recursive : [m3/1]
2. recursive : [fact/1,m0/1,m2/1,m4/1,m5/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into fact/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations fact/1 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations fact/1 
* CE 4: fact(A) = 9+ fact(B)
     [B>=0,B+1=A] 
* CE 5: fact(A) = 4
     [A=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of fact/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of fact/1 
* Loop 3: fact(A) [A=0] 
* Loop 4: fact(A)->  fact(A')
                  [A'>=0,A'+1=A] 

### Ranking functions of CR fact(A) 
* RF of phase [4]: [A]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR fact(A) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    A


### Resulting Chains:fact(A) 
* [[4],3]
* [3]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:fact(A) -> [fact(A')] 
9
#### Cost of phase [4]:fact(A) -> [fact(A')] 
9*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< A
it(4) =< A-A'
it(4) >= A-A'

#### Cost of chains of fact(A):
* Chain [[4],3]: 9*it(4)+4
  Such that:it(4) =< A
it(4) >= A

  with precondition: [A>=1] 

* Chain [3]: 4
  with precondition: [A=0] 


Closed-form bounds of fact(A): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [[4],3] with precondition: [A>=1] 
    - Lower bound: 9*A+4 
    - Complexity: n
 * Chain [3] with precondition: [A=0] 
    - Lower bound: 4 
    - Complexity: constant
 
### Partitioned lower bound of fact(A): 
* 4 
 if [A=0]
* 9*A+4 
 if [A>=1]
Possible lower bounds : [4,9*A+4]
Maximum lower bound complexity: n
