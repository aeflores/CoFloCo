Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive : [ack/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into ack/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations ack/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations ack/2 
* CE 6: ack(A,B) = 0
     [A>=0,B=0] 
* CE 7: ack(A,B) = 0
     [B>=0,A=0] 
* CE 8: ack(A,B) = 9+ ack(C,D)
     [B>=1,A>=1,A=C+1] 
* CE 9: ack(A,B) = 9+ ack(A,C)
     [B>=1,A>=1,B=C+1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of ack/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 7 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 8 

#### Loops of ack/2 
* Loop 5: ack(A,B)->  ack(A',B')
                  [B>=1,A>=1,A=A'+1] 
* Loop 6: ack(A,B)->  ack(A,B')
                  [B>=1,A>=1,B=B'+1] 
* Loop 7: ack(A,B) [A>=0,B=0] 
* Loop 8: ack(A,B) [B>=0,A=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR ack(A,B) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR ack(A,B) 
* Partial RF of phase [5,6]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    A
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    B depends on loops [5:1] 


### Resulting Chains:ack(A,B) 
* [[5,6],8]
* [[5,6],7]
* [8]
* [7]
