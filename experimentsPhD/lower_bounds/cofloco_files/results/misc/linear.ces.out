Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive : [a/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into a/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations a/1 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations a/1 
* CE 5: a(N) = 1
     [N=0] 
* CE 6: a(N) = 4+ a(O)
     [N>=1,N=O+1] 
* CE 7: a(N) = 9+ a(O)
     [N>=1,N=O+1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of a/1 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of a/1 
* Loop 4: a(N)->  a(N')
                  [N>=1,N=N'+1] 
* Loop 5: a(N)->  a(N')
                  [N>=1,N=N'+1] 
* Loop 6: a(N) [N=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* RF of phase [4,5]: [N]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* Partial RF of phase [4,5]:
  - RF of loop [4:1,5:1]:
    N


### Resulting Chains:a(N) 
* [[4,5],6]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4,5] 

 * loop 4:a(N) -> [a(N')] 
9
 * loop 5:a(N) -> [a(N')] 
4
#### Cost of phase [4,5]:a(N) -> [a(N')] 
9*it(4)+4*it(5)+0
  Such that:it(4)+it(5) =< N
it(4)+it(5) =< N-N'
it(4)+it(5) >= N-N'

#### Cost of chains of a(N):
* Chain [[4,5],6]: 9*it(4)+4*it(5)+1
  Such that:it(5)+it(4) =< N
it(5)+it(4) >= N

  with precondition: [N>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of a(N): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [[4,5],6] with precondition: [N>=1]
