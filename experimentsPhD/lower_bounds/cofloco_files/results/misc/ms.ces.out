Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive : [ms/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into ms/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations ms/2 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations ms/2 
* CE 4: ms(F,T) = 1*s(1)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< -F+T
s(1) >= -F+T
+ ms(F,U)+ ms(V,T)
     [2*U+2>=F+T,F+T>=2*U,T>=F+2,F>=0,U+1=V] 
* CE 5: ms(F,T) = 0
     [F>=T] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of ms/2 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of ms/2 
* Loop 3: ms(F,T) [F>=T] 
* Loop 4: ms(F,T)->  ms(F,T')  ms(F'2,T)
                  [2*T'+2>=F+T,F+T>=2*T',T>=F+2,F>=0,T'+1=F'2] 

### Ranking functions of CR ms(F,T) 
* RF of phase [4]: [-2*F+2*T-3]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR ms(F,T) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    2*T-3
  - RF of loop [4:1,4:2]:
    -2*F+2*T-3


### Resulting Chains:ms(F,T) 
* [3]
