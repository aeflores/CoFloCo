Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive : [a/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into a/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations a/1 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations a/1 
* CE 4: a(N) = 1+ a(O)+ a(P)
     [N>=1,N=P+1,N=O+1] 
* CE 5: a(N) = 0
     [N=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of a/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of a/1 
* Loop 3: a(N) [N=0] 
* Loop 4: a(N)->  a(N')  a(N'2)
                  [N>=1,N=N'2+1,N=N'+1] 

### Ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* RF of phase [4]: [N]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1,4:2]:
    N


### Resulting Chains:a(N) 
* [3]
* [multiple([4],[[3]])]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:a(N) -> [a(N'),a(N'2)] 
1
#### Cost of phase [4]:a(N) -> [] 
1*it(4)+0
#### Cost of chains of a(N):
* Chain [3]: 0
  with precondition: [N=0] 

* Chain [multiple([4],[[3]])]: 1*it(4)+0
  with precondition: [N>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of a(N): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [3] with precondition: [N=0] 
    - Lower bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant
 * Chain [multiple([4],[[3]])] with precondition: [N>=1] 
    - Lower bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant
 
### Partitioned lower bound of a(N): 
* 0 
 if [N>=0]
Possible lower bounds : [0]
Maximum lower bound complexity: constant
