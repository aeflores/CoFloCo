Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive : [a/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into a/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations a/1 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations a/1 
* CE 4: a(N) = 1*aux(1)+0
  Such that:aux(1) =< N
aux(1) >= N
+ a(O)
     [N>=2,N=2*O] 
* CE 5: a(N) = 0
     [1>=N] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of a/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of a/1 
* Loop 3: a(N) [1>=N] 
* Loop 4: a(N)->  a(N')
                  [N>=2,N=2*N'] 

### Ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* RF of phase [4]: [N-1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR a(N) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    N-1


### Resulting Chains:a(N) 
* [[4],3]


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:a(N) -> [a(N')] 
1*s(1)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< N
s(1) >= N

#### Cost of phase [4]:a(N) -> [a(N')] 
1*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(2) =< 2*N-2
s(2) =< 2*N-2*N'
s(2) >= 2*N-2*N'

#### Cost of chains of a(N):
* Chain [[4],3]: 1*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(2) =< 2*N-2
s(2) >= 2*N-2

  with precondition: [N>=2] 


Closed-form bounds of a(N): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [[4],3] with precondition: [N>=2] 
    - Lower bound: 2*N-2 
    - Complexity: n
 
### Partitioned lower bound of a(N): 
* 2*N-2 
 if [N>=2]
Possible lower bounds : [2*N-2]
Maximum lower bound complexity: n
