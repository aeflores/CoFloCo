Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive [multiple] : [h/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into h/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations h/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations h/2 
* CE 5: h(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: h(V,Out) = 1+ h(W,X)+ h(X,Y)
     [V>=W+1,W>=0,Out+W=V+Y+1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of h/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of h/2 
* Loop 4: h(V,Out)->  h(V',Out')  h(Out',A'2)
                  [V>=V'+1,V'>=0,V+A'2+1=Out+V'] 
* Loop 5: h(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V depends on loops [4:2] 


### Resulting Chains:h(V,Out) 
* [multiple([4],[[],[5]])]...
* [5]


### Merging Chains  h/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[multiple([4],[[],[5]])]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 7: start(V) = 0+ h(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 8: start(V) = 0+ h(V,W):2
     [V>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=1] 
* Loop 7: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [7]
* [6]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:h(V,Out) -> [h(V',Out'),h(V'2,Out'2)] 
1
#### Cost of phase [4]:h(V,Out) -> [] 
1*it(4)+0
#### Cost of chains of h(V,Out):
* Chain [multiple([4],[[],[5]])]...: 1*it(4)+0
  with precondition: [V>=1] 

* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 

* Chain [6]...: 1*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [V>=1] 


Closed-form bounds of start(V): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [7] with precondition: [V>=0] 
    - Upper bound: 0 
    - Complexity: constant 
* Chain [6]... with precondition: [V>=1] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of start(V): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity
