=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [t/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into t/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations t/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations t/2 
* CE 5: t(A,A) = 1
     [A>=0] 
* CE 6: t(V,Out) = 1
     [V>=0,V+5=Out] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of t/2 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of t/2 
* Loop 4: t(A,A) [A>=0] 
* Loop 5: t(V,Out) [V>=0,V+5=Out] 

### Ranking functions of CR t(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR t(V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:t(V,Out) 
* [5]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  t/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 7: start(V) = 0+ t(W,X):1
     [X>=5,X=W+5,X=V+5] 
* CE 8: start(V) = 0+ t(V,V):2
     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of t(V,Out):
* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [V+5=Out,V>=0] 

* Chain [4]: 1
  with precondition: [V=Out,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [6]: 1
  with precondition: [V>=0]
