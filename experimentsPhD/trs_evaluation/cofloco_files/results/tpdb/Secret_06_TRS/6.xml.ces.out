Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [a/3]
1. non_recursive  : [b/3]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into b/3
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations b/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations b/3 
* CE 5: b(V1,V,Out) = 3
     [Out>=2,V1>=0,Out=V+2] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of b/3 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of b/3 
* Loop 3: b(V1,V,Out) [Out>=2,V1>=0,Out=V+2] 

### Ranking functions of CR b(V1,V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR b(V1,V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:b(V1,V,Out) 
* [3]


### Merging Chains  b/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[3]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 6: start(V1,V) = 1
     [V>=0,V1>=0] 
* CE 7: start(V1,V) = 0+ b(V1,W1,X1):1
     [X1>=2,V1>=0,X1=W1+2,X1=V+2] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [6,7] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 4: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [4]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of b(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [3]: 3
  with precondition: [V+2=Out,V1>=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V1,V):
* Chain [4]: 3
  with precondition: [V1>=0,V>=0]
