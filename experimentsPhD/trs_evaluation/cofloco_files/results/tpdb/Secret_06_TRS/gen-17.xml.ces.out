=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [c/4]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into c/4
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations c/4 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations c/4 
* CE 5: c(V,V1,V5,Out) = 0
     [V5>=0,V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: c(V,V1,V5,Out) = 1
     [2*V1>=Out,Out>=2,V5>=0,V=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of c/4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of c/4 
* Loop 4: c(V,V1,V5,Out) [V5>=0,V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 
* Loop 5: c(V,V1,V5,Out) [2*V1>=Out,Out>=2,V5>=0,V=1] 

### Ranking functions of CR c(V,V1,V5,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR c(V,V1,V5,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:c(V,V1,V5,Out) 
* [5]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  c/4 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/3 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/3 
* CE 7: start(V,V1,V5) = 0+ c(W5,V1,V5,X5):1
     [2*V1>=X5,X5>=2,V5>=0,W5=1,V=1] 
* CE 8: start(V,V1,V5) = 0+ c(V,V1,V5,W5):2
     [V5>=0,V1>=0,V>=0,W5=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/3 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/3 
* Loop 6: start(V,V1,V5) [V5>=0,V1>=0,V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V,V1,V5) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V,V1,V5) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V,V1,V5) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1
