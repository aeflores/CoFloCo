Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [b/3]
1. non_recursive  : [f/2]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 6: f(V,Out) = 2
     [V>=Out+1,Out>=0] 
* CE 7: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 4: f(V,Out) [V>=Out+1,Out>=0] 
* Loop 5: f(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [5]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9,10] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 8: start(V,V1) = 1
     [V1>=0,V>=0] 
* CE 9: start(V,V1) = 0+ f(V,W1):1
     [V>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 10: start(V,V1) = 0+ f(V,W1):2
     [V>=W1+1,W1>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [8,9,10] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V,V1) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V,V1) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 

* Chain [4]: 2
  with precondition: [Out>=0,V>=Out+1] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V,V1):
* Chain [6]: 2
  with precondition: [V>=0]
