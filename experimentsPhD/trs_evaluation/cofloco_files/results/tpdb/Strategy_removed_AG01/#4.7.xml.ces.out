Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f/2]
1. non_recursive  : [fun/1]
2. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 6: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 7: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(W,Out)
     [W>=1,W+1=2*V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 4: f(V,Out)->  f(V',Out)
                  [V'>=1,V'+1=2*V] 
* Loop 5: f(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [[4]]...
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5],[5,[4]]] --> 1 
* [[[4]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9,10] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 8: start(V) = 1
     [] 
* CE 9: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 10: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):2
     [V>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=1] 
* Loop 7: start(V) [] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [7]
* [6]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1
#### Cost of phase [4]:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
#### Cost of phase [4]:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [[4]]...: 1*it(4)+0
  with precondition: [V>=1] 

* Chain [[4],5]: 1*it(4)+0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=1] 

* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [7]: 1*aux(2)+0
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [6]...: 1*s(3)+0
  with precondition: [V>=1]
