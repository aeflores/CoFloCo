Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [g/2]
1. recursive  : [f/3]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f/3
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/3 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations f/3 
* CE 6: f(V1,V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 7: f(A,A,B) = 2+ f(C,A,B)
     [A>=0,A+1=C] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/3 
* Loop 4: f(A,A,B)->  f(A',A,B)
                  [A>=0,A+1=A'] 
* Loop 5: f(V1,V,Out) [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:f(V1,V,Out) 
* [5]
* [4,5]


### Merging Chains  f/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5,4],[5]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 8: start(V1,V) = 0+ f(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 9: start(V1,V) = 1
     [V1>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of f(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V1>=0,V>=0] 

* Chain [4,5]: 2
  with precondition: [Out=0,V1=V,V1>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V1,V):
* Chain [6]: 2
  with precondition: [V1>=0]
