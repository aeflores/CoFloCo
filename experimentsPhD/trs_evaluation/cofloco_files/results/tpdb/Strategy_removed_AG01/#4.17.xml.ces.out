Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [g/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into g/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations g/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations g/2 
* CE 5: g(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=0,V=0] 
* CE 6: g(V,Out) = 1+ g(W,X)
     [W>=0,X+1=Out,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of g/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of g/2 
* Loop 4: g(V,Out)->  g(V',Out')
                  [V'>=0,Out=Out'+1,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 5: g(V,Out) [Out=0,V=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR g(V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR g(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V


### Resulting Chains:g(V,Out) 
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  g/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[5,[4]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 7: start(V) = 0+ g(W,X):1
     [X=0,W=0,V=0] 
* CE 8: start(V) = 0+ g(V,V):2
     [V>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=1] 
* Loop 7: start(V) [V=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [7]
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:g(V,Out) -> [g(V',Out')]

#### Cost of phase [4]:g(V,Out) -> [g(V',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V

#### Cost of chains of g(V,Out):
* Chain [[4],5]: 1*it(4)+1
  Such that:it(4) =< Out

  with precondition: [V=Out,V>=1] 

* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [V=0,Out=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [7]: 1
  with precondition: [V=0] 

* Chain [6]: 1*s(1)+1
