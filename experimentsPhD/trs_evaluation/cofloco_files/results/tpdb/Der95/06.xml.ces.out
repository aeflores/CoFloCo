Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 6: f(V,Out) = 1
     [V>=1,V+2=Out] 
* CE 7: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 8: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(W,X)
     [W>=0,X+2=Out,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 5: f(V,Out)->  f(V',Out')
                  [V'>=0,Out=Out'+2,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 6: f(V,Out) [V>=1,V+2=Out] 
* Loop 7: f(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out)

* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2 
* [[7,[5]]] --> 3

### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [9,10,11,12] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 9: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 10: start(V) = 0+ f(W,X):2
     [X>=3,X=W+2,X=V+2] 
* CE 11: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):3
     [2*V>=W,W>=2] 
* CE 12: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):4
     [2*V+1>=W,W>=V+3] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [9,10,11,12] --> Loop 8 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 8: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [8]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[8]] --> 1
