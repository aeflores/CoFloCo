Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations fun/2 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 7 is refined into CE [10] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [11] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [12] 


#### Refined cost equations fun/2 
* CE 8: fun(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=1,V=3] 
* CE 9: fun(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=0,V=2] 
* CE 10: fun(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 11: fun(V,Out) = 1+ fun(W,X)+ fun(Y,Z)
     [Y>=0,W>=0,W+X+Y+Z+3=Out,W+Y+1=V] 
* CE 12: fun(V,Out) = 1+ fun(W,X)+ fun(Y,Z)
     [Y>=0,W>=0,X+Z+1=Out,W+Y+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of fun/2 
* CEs [11] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [12] --> Loop 7 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [9,10] --> Loop 9 

#### Loops of fun/2

                  [V>=V'+1,V'>=0,V+Out'+Out'2+2=Out,V'+V'2+1=V] 
* Loop 7: fun(V,Out)->  fun(V',Out')  fun(V'2,Out'2)
                  [V>=V'+1,V'>=0,Out=Out'+Out'2+1,V'+V'2+1=V] 
* Loop 8: fun(V,Out) [Out=1,V=3] 
* Loop 9: fun(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0]

* CE 2 is refined into CE [13,14] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 13: start(V) = 0+ fun(V,W):1
     [W>=1,V>=1] 
* CE 14: start(V) = 0+ fun(V,W):2
     [V>=0,W=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [13,14] --> Loop 10 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 10: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [10]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[10]] --> 1
