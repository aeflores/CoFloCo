Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive [multiple] : [times/3]
1. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into times/3
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations times/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations times/3 
* CE 5: times(V,V1,Out) = 0
     [V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: times(V,V1,Out) = 1+ times(V,W1,X1)+ times(V,Y1,Z1)
     [Y1>=0,W1>=0,V>=0,X1+Z1+1=Out,W1+Y1+1=V1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of times/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of times/3 
* Loop 4: times(V,V1,Out)->  times(V,V1',Out')  times(V,V1'2,Out'2)
                  [V1'2>=0,V1'>=0,V>=0,Out=Out'+Out'2+1,V1'+V1'2+1=V1] 
* Loop 5: times(V,V1,Out) [V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR times(V,V1,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR times(V,V1,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1,4:2]:
    V1


### Resulting Chains:times(V,V1,Out) 
* [5]
* [multiple([4],[[5]])]


### Merging Chains  times/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[multiple([4],[[5]])]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 7: start(V,V1) = 0+ times(V,V1,W1):1
     [V1>=0,V>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 8: start(V,V1) = 0+ times(V,V1,W1):2
     [V1>=W1,W1>=1,V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V,V1) [V1>=0,V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V,V1) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:times(V,V1,Out) -> [times(V',V1',Out'),times(V'2,V1'2,Out'2)] 
1
#### Cost of phase [4]:times(V,V1,Out) -> [] 
1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V1

#### Cost of chains of times(V,V1,Out):
* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0,V1>=0] 

* Chain [multiple([4],[[5]])]: 1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V1

  with precondition: [V>=0,Out>=1,V1>=Out] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V,V1):
* Chain [6]: 1*s(1)+0
  Such that:s(1) =< V1

  with precondition: [V>=0,V1>=0]
