Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [plus/3]
1. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into plus/3
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations plus/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations plus/3 
* CE 5: plus(V,V1,Out) = 0
     [V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: plus(V,V1,Out) = 1+ plus(W1,X1,Y1)
     [V1+W1>=V,V>=W1+1,W1>=0,V+Y1=Out+W1,V1+W1=V+X1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of plus/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of plus/3 
* Loop 4: plus(V,V1,Out)->  plus(V',V1',Out')
                  [V1+V'>=V,V>=V'+1,V'>=0,V+Out'=Out+V',V+V1'=V1+V'] 
* Loop 5: plus(V,V1,Out) [V1>=0,V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR plus(V,V1,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V,V1]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR plus(V,V1,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V
    V1


### Resulting Chains:plus(V,V1,Out) 
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  plus/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[5,[4]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 7: start(V,V1) = 0+ plus(V,V1,W1):1
     [V1>=0,V>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 8: start(V,V1) = 0+ plus(V,V1,W1):2
     [V1>=W1,V>=W1,W1>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V,V1) [V1>=0,V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V,V1) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V,V1) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1

#### Cost of phase [4]:plus(V,V1,Out) -> [plus(V',V1',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V
it(4) =< V-V'
it(4) =< V1

#### Cost of chains of plus(V,V1,Out):
* Chain [[4],5]: 1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< Out

  with precondition: [Out>=1,V>=Out,V1>=Out] 

* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0,V1>=0]
