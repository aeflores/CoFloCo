Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive [multiple] : [f/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 6: f(V,Out) = 1
     [V>=1,V+1=Out] 
* CE 7: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 8: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(W,X)+ f(X,Y)
     [W>=0,Y+1=Out,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 5: f(V,Out)->  f(V',Out')  f(Out',A'2)
                  [V'>=0,Out=A'2+1,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 6: f(V,Out) [V>=1,V+1=Out] 
* Loop 7: f(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [5]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    V depends on loops [5:2] 


### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [multiple([5],[[],[7],[6]])]...
* [7]
* [6]


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2 
* [[multiple([5],[[],[7],[6]])]] --> 3 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [9,10,11] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 9: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 10: start(V) = 0+ f(W,X):2
     [X>=2,X=W+1,X=V+1] 
* CE 11: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):3
     [V>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [11] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [9,10] --> Loop 9 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 8: start(V) [V>=1] 
* Loop 9: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [9]
* [8]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[9]] --> 1 
* [[8]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [5] 

 * loop 5:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out'),f(V'2,Out'2)] 
1
#### Cost of phase [5]:f(V,Out) -> [] 
1*it(5)+1*it([6])+0
#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [multiple([5],[[],[7],[6]])]...: 1*it(5)+1*it([6])+0
  with precondition: [V>=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 

* Chain [6]: 1
  with precondition: [V+1=Out,V>=1] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [9]: 1
  with precondition: [V>=0] 

* Chain [8]...: 2*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [V>=1]
