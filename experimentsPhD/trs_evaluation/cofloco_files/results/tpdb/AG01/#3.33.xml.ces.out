Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations q/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 7 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [10] 


#### Refined cost equations q/2 
* CE 8: q(V,Out) = 1
     [V>=2,Out=0] 
* CE 9: q(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 10: q(V,Out) = 2+ q(V,Out)
     [V>=2] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of q/2 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of q/2 
* Loop 4: q(V,Out)->  q(V,Out)

* CEs [11,12,14] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=2]

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4]

* Chain [[4],5]: 2*it(4)+1
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=2] 

* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [7]: 1*aux(2)+0
