Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f/4]
1. non_recursive  : [start/3]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/4
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/3

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/4 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations f/4 
* CE 5: f(V1,V,V2,Out) = 0
     [V2>=0,V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: f(A,B,B,C) = 1+ f(B,D,E,C)
     [D>=0,B>=0,D+1=E,D+1=A] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/4 
* Loop 4: f(A,B,B,C)->  f(B,A',B',C)
                  [A'>=0,B>=0,A'+1=B',A'+1=A] 
* Loop 5: f(V1,V,V2,Out) [V2>=0,V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,V2,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,V2,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:f(V1,V,V2,Out) 
* [5]
* [4,5]


### Merging Chains  f/4 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5,4],[5]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/3 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/3 
* CE 7: start(V1,V,V2) = 0+ f(V1,V,V2,W2):1
     [V2>=0,V>=0,V1>=0,W2=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/3 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V,V2) [V2>=0,V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V,V2) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V,V2) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V,V2) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1
