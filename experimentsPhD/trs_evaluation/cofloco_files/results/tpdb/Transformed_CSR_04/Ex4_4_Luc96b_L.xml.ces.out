Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 5: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 6: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(W,Out)
     [W>=0,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 4: f(V,Out)->  f(V',Out)
                  [V'>=0,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 5: f(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V


### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5],[5,[4]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 7: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1
#### Cost of phase [4]:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V
it(4) =< V-V'

#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [[4],5]: 1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V

  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=1] 

* Chain [5]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [6]: 1*s(2)+0
  Such that:s(2) =< V

  with precondition: [V>=0]
