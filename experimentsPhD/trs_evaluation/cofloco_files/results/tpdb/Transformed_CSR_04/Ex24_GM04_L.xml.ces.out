Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [b/1]
1. recursive  : [f/1]
2. non_recursive  : [start/0]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f/1
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/0

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/1 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations f/1 
* CE 5: f(Out) = 1+ f(Out)
     [] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of f/1 
* Loop 3: f(Out)->  f(Out)
                  [] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(Out) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:f(Out) 
* [[3]]...


### Merging Chains  f/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[[3]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/0 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/0 
* CE 6: start = 0+ f(B):1
     [] 
* CE 7: start = 1
     [] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/0 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of start/0 
* Loop 4: start [] 
* Loop 5: start [] 

### Ranking functions of CR start 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start 


### Resulting Chains:start 
* [5]
* [4]...


### Merging Chains  start/0 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [3] 

 * loop 3:f(Out) -> [f(Out')] 
1
#### Cost of phase [3]:f(Out) -> [f(Out')] 
1*it(3)+0
#### Cost of chains of f(Out):
* Chain [[3]]...: 1*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [] 


#### Cost of chains of start:
* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [4]...: 1*s(1)+0
  with precondition: []
