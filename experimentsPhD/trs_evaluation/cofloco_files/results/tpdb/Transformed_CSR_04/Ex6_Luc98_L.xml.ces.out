Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [first/3]
1. non_recursive  : [from/2]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into first/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations first/3 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations first/3 
* CE 7: first(A,B,B) = 1
     [B>=1,A>=1] 
* CE 8: first(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V>=0,Out=0,V1=0] 
* CE 9: first(V1,V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of first/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of first/3 
* Loop 4: first(A,B,B) [B>=1,A>=1] 
* Loop 5: first(V1,V,Out) [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR first(V1,V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR first(V1,V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:first(V1,V,Out) 
* [5]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  first/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [10,11] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [12] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 10: start(V1,V) = 0+ first(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 11: start(V1,V) = 0+ first(V1,V,V):2
     [V>=1,V1>=1] 
* CE 12: start(V1,V) = 1
     [V1>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [10,11,12] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of first(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [5]: 1
