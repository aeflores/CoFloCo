Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations activate/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations activate/2 
* CE 7: activate(V,Out) = 2
     [Out=0,V=0] 
* CE 8: activate(A,A) = 1
     [A>=0] 
* CE 9: activate(V,Out) = 2+ activate(W,X)
     [X>=0,W>=0,X+1=Out,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of activate/2 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [7,8] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of activate/2 
* Loop 4: activate(V,Out)->  activate(V',Out')
                  [Out'>=0,V'>=0,Out'+1=Out,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 5: activate(A,A) [A>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR activate(V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V]

### Resulting Chains:activate(V,Out) 
* [[4],5]

### Merging Chains  activate/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5],[5,[4]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [10] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [11] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 10: start(V) = 1

     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [10,11] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1
