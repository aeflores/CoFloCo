Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations c/1

#### Refined cost equations f/2

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of c(Out):
* Chain [6]: 1
  with precondition: [Out=0] 

* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [Out=1] 


#### Cost of loops [7] 

 * loop 7:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1
#### Cost of phase [7]:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
1*it(7)+0
#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [[7]]...: 1*it(7)+0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [9]...: 1*s(1)+0
