=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [f/2]
1. non_recursive  : [activate/2]
2. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into activate/2
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations activate/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations activate/2 
* CE 6: activate(A,A) = 2
     [A>=1] 
* CE 7: activate(A,A) = 1
     [A>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of activate/2 
* CEs [6,7] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of activate/2 
* Loop 3: activate(A,A) [A>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR activate(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR activate(V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:activate(V,Out) 
* [3]


### Merging Chains  activate/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[3]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 8: start(V) = 0+ activate(V,V):1
     [V>=0] 
* CE 9: start(V) = 1
     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 4: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [4]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of activate(V,Out):
* Chain [3]: 2
  with precondition: [V=Out,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
