Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [c/1]
1. recursive  : [f/2]
2. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 5: f(V,Out) = 2+ f(W,Out)
     [V>=0,W=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 3: f(V,Out)->  f(V',Out)
                  [V>=0,V'=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [[3]]...


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[[3]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 6: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0] 
* CE 7: start(V) = 1
     [] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 4: start(V) [] 
* Loop 5: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [5]...
* [4]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 
* [[5]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [3] 

 * loop 3:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
2
#### Cost of phase [3]:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out')] 
2*it(3)+0
#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [[3]]...: 2*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [5]...: 2*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 

* Chain [4]: 1
  with precondition: []
