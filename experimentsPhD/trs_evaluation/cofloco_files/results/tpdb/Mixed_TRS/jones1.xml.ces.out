Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations r1/3 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations r1/3 
* CE 6: r1(V,V2,Out) = 1+ r1(W2,X2,Out)
     [V+V2>=X2,X2>=V2+1,V2>=0,V+V2=W2+X2] 
* CE 7: r1(A,B,B) = 1
     [B>=0,A=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of r1/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of r1/3 
* Loop 4: r1(A,B,B) [B>=0,A=0]

                  [V+V2>=V2',V2'>=V2+1,V2>=0,V+V2=V'+V2']

* CE 11: start(V,V2) = 0+ r1(V,W2,X2):2
     [X2>=V,V>=1,X2=V+W2,X2=V+V2]

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V,V2) [V>=1]
