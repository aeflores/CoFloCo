=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components

1. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/3
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations f/3 
* CE 5: f(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V>=0,Out=0,V1=0] 
* CE 6: f(V1,V,Out) = 1+ f(V,W1,Out)
     [W1>=0,V>=0,W1+1=V1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/3 
* Loop 4: f(V1,V,Out)->  f(V,A',Out)
                  [A'>=0,V>=0,A'+1=V1] 
* Loop 5: f(V1,V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0,V1=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V1+V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V1+V


### Resulting Chains:f(V1,V,Out) 
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  f/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[5,[4]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 7: start(V1,V) = 0+ f(W1,V,X1):1
     [V>=0,X1=0,W1=0,V1=0] 
* CE 8: start(V1,V) = 0+ f(V1,V,W1):2
     [V>=0,V1>=1,W1=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=1] 
* Loop 7: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V)

* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2
