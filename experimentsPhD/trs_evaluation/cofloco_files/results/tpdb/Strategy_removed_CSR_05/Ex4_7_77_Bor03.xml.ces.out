Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations tail/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations tail/2

Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of tail(V,Out):
* Chain [6]: 0

1*it(7)+0
#### Cost of chains of zeros(Out):
* Chain [[7]]...: 1*it(7)+0
  with precondition: []
