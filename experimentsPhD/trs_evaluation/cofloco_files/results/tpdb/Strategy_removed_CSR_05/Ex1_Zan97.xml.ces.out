Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [c/1]
1. recursive  : [g/2,h/2]
2. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into h/2
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations h/2 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations h/2 
* CE 6: h(V,Out) = 3+ h(W,Out)
     [W=0,V=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of h/2 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of h/2 
* Loop 3: h(V,Out)->  h(V',Out)
                  [V'=0,V=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:h(V,Out) 
* [[3]]...


### Merging Chains  h/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[[3]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 7: start(V) = 1+ h(W,X):1
     [W=0,V=0] 
* CE 8: start(V) = 1
     [] 
* CE 9: start(V) = 0+ h(W,X):1
     [W=0,V=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [7,9] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 4: start(V) [V=0] 
* Loop 5: start(V) [] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [5]
* [4]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [3] 

 * loop 3:h(V,Out) -> [h(V',Out')] 
3
#### Cost of phase [3]:h(V,Out) -> [h(V',Out')] 
3*it(3)+0
#### Cost of chains of h(V,Out):
* Chain [[3]]...: 3*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [V=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [] 

* Chain [4]...: 1*aux(1)+0
  with precondition: [V=0]
