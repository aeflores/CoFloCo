Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive [multiple] : [f/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/2
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [4] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 4: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(V,W)+ f(W,Out)
     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/2 
* CEs [4] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of f/2 
* Loop 3: f(V,Out)->  f(V,Out')  f(Out',Out)
                  [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V,Out) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:f(V,Out) 
* [multiple([3],[[]])]...


### Merging Chains  f/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[multiple([3],[[]])]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 5: start(V) = 0+ f(V,W):1
     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 4: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [4]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [3] 

 * loop 3:f(V,Out) -> [f(V',Out'),f(V'2,Out'2)] 
1
#### Cost of phase [3]:f(V,Out) -> [] 
1*it(3)+0
#### Cost of chains of f(V,Out):
* Chain [multiple([3],[[]])]...: 1*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [4]...: 1*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [V>=0] 


Closed-form bounds of start(V): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [4]... with precondition: [V>=0] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of start(V): inf 
Asymptotic class: infinity
