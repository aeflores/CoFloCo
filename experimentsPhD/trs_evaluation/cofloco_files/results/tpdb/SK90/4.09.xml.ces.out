Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [plus/3]
1. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into plus/3
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations plus/3 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations plus/3 
* CE 6: plus(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V1>=0,V1+1=V,Out=0] 
* CE 7: plus(V1,V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 8: plus(A,B,A) = 1
     [A>=0,B=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of plus/3 
* CEs [6,7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of plus/3 
* Loop 4: plus(V1,V,Out) [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* Loop 5: plus(A,B,A) [A>=0,B=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR plus(V1,V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR plus(V1,V,Out) 


### Resulting Chains:plus(V1,V,Out) 
* [5]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  plus/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[4]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [9,10] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 9: start(V1,V) = 0+ plus(V1,W1,V1):1
     [V1>=0,W1=0,V=0] 
* CE 10: start(V1,V) = 0+ plus(V1,V,W1):2
     [V>=0,V1>=0,W1=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [9,10] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1
