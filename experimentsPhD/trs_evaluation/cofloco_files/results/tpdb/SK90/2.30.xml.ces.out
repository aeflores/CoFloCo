Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [eq/3]
1. non_recursive  : [implies/3]
2. non_recursive  : [not/2]
3. non_recursive  : [or/3]
4. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
3. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
4. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [3] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 3: start(V,V2) = 1
     [V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [3] --> Loop 2 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 2: start(V,V2) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V,V2) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V,V2) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V,V2) 
* [2]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[2]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of start(V,V2):
* Chain [2]: 1
  with precondition: [V>=0] 


Closed-form bounds of start(V,V2): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [V>=0] 
    - Upper bound: 1 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of start(V,V2): 1
