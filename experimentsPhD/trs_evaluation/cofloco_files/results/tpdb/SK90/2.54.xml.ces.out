Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [f/3]
1. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into f/3
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [6] 


#### Refined cost equations f/3 
* CE 5: f(V1,V,Out) = 1+ f(W1,X1,Out)
     [X1>=0,V1>=0,V1+1=W1,X1+1=V] 
* CE 6: f(A,B,A) = 1
     [A>=0,B=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of f/3 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of f/3 
* Loop 4: f(A,B,A) [A>=0,B=0] 
* Loop 5: f(V1,V,Out)->  f(V1',V',Out)
                  [V'>=0,V1>=0,V1+1=V1',V'+1=V] 

### Ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 
* RF of phase [5]: [V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR f(V1,V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [5]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    V


### Resulting Chains:f(V1,V,Out) 
* [[5],4]
* [4]


### Merging Chains  f/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 
* [[4,[5]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [7,8] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 7: start(V1,V) = 0+ f(V1,W1,V1):1
     [V1>=0,W1=0,V=0] 
* CE 8: start(V1,V) = 0+ f(V1,W1,X1):2
     [X1>=V1+1,V1>=0,X1=V1+W1,X1=V1+V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V>=1,V1>=0] 
* Loop 7: start(V1,V) [V1>=0,V=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [7]
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6]] --> 2

#### Cost of chains of f(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [[5],4]: 1*it(5)+1
  Such that:it(5) =< V

  with precondition: [V+V1=Out,V1>=0,V>=1] 

* Chain [4]: 1
  with precondition: [V=0,V1=Out,V1>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V1,V):
* Chain [7]: 1
  with precondition: [V=0,V1>=0] 

* Chain [6]: 1*s(1)+1
  Such that:s(1) =< V

  with precondition: [V1>=0,V>=1]
