#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive [multiple] : [f/2,h/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into h/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations h/2 
* CE 7 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [10] 


#### Refined cost equations h/2 
* CE 8: h(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 9: h(V,Out) = 2+ h(W,X)+ h(Y,Z)
     [Y=X+1,Z+1=Out,W=0,V=1] 
* CE 10: h(V,Out) = 1+ h(W,X)
     [V>=1,X+1=Out,W=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of h/2 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of h/2 
* Loop 5: h(V,Out)->  h(V',Out')
                  [V>=1,Out=Out'+1,V'=0] 
* Loop 6: h(V,Out)->  h(V',Out')  h(V'2,Out'2)
                  [Out=Out'2+1,Out'+1=V'2,V'=0,V=1] 
* Loop 7: h(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR h(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [6]:
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    V depends on loops [6:2] 


### Resulting Chains:h(V,Out) 
* [multiple([6],[[],[7],[5,7]])]...
* [7]
* [5,7]


### Merging Chains  h/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[7,5]] --> 2 
* [[multiple([6],[[],[7],[5,7]])]] --> 3 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [11] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [12] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [13,14,15] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 11: start(V) = 0
     [V>=0] 
* CE 12: start(V) = 1+ h(W,X):1
     [X=0,W=0,V=0] 
* CE 13: start(V) = 0+ h(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 14: start(V) = 0+ h(V,W):2
     [V>=1,W=1] 
* CE 15: start(V) = 0+ h(W,X):3
     [W=1,V=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [15] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [11,12,13,14] --> Loop 9 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 8: start(V) [V=1] 
* Loop 9: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [9]
* [8]...


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[9]] --> 1 
* [[8]] --> 2 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [6] 

 * loop 6:h(V,Out) -> [h(V',Out'),h(V'2,Out'2)] 
2
#### Cost of phase [6]:h(V,Out) -> [] 
2*it(6)+1*it([5,7])+0
#### Cost of chains of h(V,Out):
* Chain [multiple([6],[[],[7],[5,7]])]...: 2*it(6)+1*it([5,7])+0
  with precondition: [V=1] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 

* Chain [5,7]: 1
  with precondition: [Out=1,V>=1] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [9]: 1
  with precondition: [V>=0] 

* Chain [8]...: 3*s(1)+0
  with precondition: [V=1]
