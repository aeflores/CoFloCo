Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations f/2 
* CE 7 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [10] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [11] 


#### Refined cost equations f/2 
* CE 8: f(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 9: f(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=1,V=0] 
* CE 10: f(V,Out) = 1+ f(W,X)+ f(W,Y)
     [W>=0,X+Y+2=Out,W+1=V] 
* CE 11: f(V,Out) = 2+ f(W,X)
     [X>=0,W>=0,2*X+2=Out,W+1=V]

     [W>=2,V>=1] 
* CE 15: start(V) = 1
     [V>=0]
