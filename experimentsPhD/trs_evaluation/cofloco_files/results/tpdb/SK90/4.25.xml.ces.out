Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations rev/2 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [10] 


#### Refined cost equations rev/2 
* CE 7: rev(V,Out) = 1+ rev(W,Out)
     [W>=0,2*W+1=V] 
* CE 8: rev(V,Out) = 1+ rev(W,X)+ rev(Y,Z)
     [Y>=0,W>=0,X+Z+1=Out,W+Y+1=V] 
* CE 9: rev(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=1,V=1] 
* CE 10: rev(V,Out) = 1
     [Out=0,V=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of rev/2 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 7

                  [V'2>=0,V'>=0,Out=Out'+Out'2+1,V'+V'2+1=V] 
* Loop 9: rev(V,Out)->  rev(V',Out)
