Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations g/3 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations g/3 
* CE 7: g(V1,V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 8: g(V1,V,Out) = 2+ g(W1,V,X1)
     [W1>=0,V>=0,X1+1=Out,W1+1=V1] 
* CE 9: g(V1,V,Out) = 1+ g(W1,V,X1)
     [W1>=0,V>=0,X1+1=Out,W1+1=V1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of g/3 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of g/3 
* Loop 4: g(V1,V,Out)->  g(V1',V,Out')
                  [V1'>=0,V>=0,Out=Out'+1,V1'+1=V1]

### Ranking functions of CR g(V1,V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V1]

* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  g/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5]] --> 1 
* [[5,[4]]] --> 2 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [10,11] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [12,13] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 10: start(V1,V) = 1+ g(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 11: start(V1,V) = 1+ g(V1,V,W1):2
     [V1>=W1,W1>=1,V>=0] 
* CE 12: start(V1,V) = 0+ g(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0,W1=0] 
* CE 13: start(V1,V) = 0+ g(V1,V,W1):2
     [V1>=W1,W1>=1,V>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [10,11,12,13] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1
