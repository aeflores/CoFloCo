Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations times/3 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [10] 


#### Refined cost equations times/3 
* CE 7: times(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V>=0,V+1=V1,Out=1] 
* CE 8: times(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V1>=0,Out=0,V=0] 
* CE 9: times(V1,V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,V1>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 10: times(A,B,B) = 1
     [B>=0,A=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of times/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of times/3 
* Loop 5: times(V1,V,Out) [V1>=1,V1=V+1,Out=1]
