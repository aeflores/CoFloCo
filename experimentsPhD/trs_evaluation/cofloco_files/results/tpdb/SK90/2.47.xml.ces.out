Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations a/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations a/2 
* CE 6: a(V,Out) = 1
     [Out>=0,Out+1=V] 
* CE 7: a(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 8: a(V,Out) = 1+ a(W,X)
     [W>=0,X+1=Out,W+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of a/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 5 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of a/2 
* Loop 5: a(V,Out)->  a(V',Out')
                  [V'>=0,Out=Out'+1,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 6: a(V,Out) [V>=1,V=Out+1] 
* Loop 7: a(V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR a(V,Out) 
* RF of phase [5]: [V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR a(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [5]:
  - RF of loop [5:1]:
    V


### Resulting Chains:a(V,Out)

* [[5],6]
* [7]
* [6]


### Merging Chains  a/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[7]] --> 1 
* [[6],[6,[5]]] --> 2 
* [[7,[5]]] --> 3 


### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [9,10,11] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 9: start(V) = 0+ a(V,W):1
     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 10: start(V) = 0+ a(W,X):2
     [X>=0,X+1=W,X+1=V] 
* CE 11: start(V) = 0+ a(V,W):3
     [V>=W,W>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [9,10,11] --> Loop 8 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 8: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [8]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[8]] --> 1

  with precondition: [V=Out+1,V>=2] 

* Chain [7]: 0
  with precondition: [Out=0,V>=0] 

* Chain [6]: 1
