Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. non_recursive  : [p/2]
1. non_recursive  : [start/1]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
1. SCC is partially evaluated into start/1

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [3] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1 
* CE 3: start(V) = 1
     [V=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [3] --> Loop 2 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 2: start(V) [V=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V) 
* [2]


### Merging Chains  start/1 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[2]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of chains of start(V):
* Chain [2]: 1
  with precondition: [V=0] 


Closed-form bounds of start(V): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [2] with precondition: [V=0] 
    - Upper bound: 1 
    - Complexity: constant 

### Maximum cost of start(V): 1 
Asymptotic class: constant
