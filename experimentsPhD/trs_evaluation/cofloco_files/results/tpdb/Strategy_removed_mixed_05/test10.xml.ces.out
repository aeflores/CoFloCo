Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [g/3]
1. non_recursive  : [h/3]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into g/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations g/3 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations g/3 
* CE 6: g(V1,V,Out) = 1
     [V>=0,Out=0,V1=0] 
* CE 7: g(V1,V,Out) = 1+ g(V1,W1,Out)
     [W1>=0,V1>=0,W1+1=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of g/3 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [6] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of g/3 
* Loop 4: g(V1,V,Out)->  g(V1,V',Out)
                  [V'>=0,V1>=0,V'+1=V] 
* Loop 5: g(V1,V,Out) [V>=0,Out=0,V1=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR g(V1,V,Out) 
* RF of phase [4]: [V]

#### Partial ranking functions of CR g(V1,V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [4]:
  - RF of loop [4:1]:
    V


### Resulting Chains:g(V1,V,Out) 
* [[4],5]
* [5]


### Merging Chains  g/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[5],[5,[4]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [9] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 8: start(V1,V) = 1
     [V>=0,V1>=0] 
* CE 9: start(V1,V) = 0+ g(W1,V,X1):1
     [V>=0,X1=0,W1=0,V1=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [8,9] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 6: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 


### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [6]


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[6]] --> 1

=====================================

#### Cost of loops [4] 

 * loop 4:g(V1,V,Out) -> [g(V1',V',Out')]

#### Cost of phase [4]:g(V1,V,Out) -> [g(V1',V',Out')] 
1*it(4)+0
  Such that:it(4) =< V
it(4) =< V-V'

#### Cost of chains of g(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [[4],5]: 1*it(4)+1
  Such that:it(4) =< V

  with precondition: [V1=0,Out=0,V>=1] 

* Chain [5]: 1
  with precondition: [V1=0,Out=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V1,V):
* Chain [6]: 1*s(2)+1
