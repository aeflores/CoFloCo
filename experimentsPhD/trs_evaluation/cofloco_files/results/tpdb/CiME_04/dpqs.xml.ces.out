Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations g/2 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [8] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [9] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [10] 


#### Refined cost equations g/2 
* CE 7: g(V,Out) = 1
     [Out>=0,Out+1=V] 
* CE 8: g(V,Out) = 0
     [V>=0,Out=0] 
* CE 9: g(V,Out) = 1+ g(W,Out)
     [W=2,V=3] 
* CE 10: g(V,Out) = 1+ g(W,Out)
     [W=3,V=2] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of g/2 
* CEs [9] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [10] --> Loop 7 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 8 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 9 

#### Loops of g/2 
* Loop 6: g(V,Out)->  g(V',Out)
                  [V'=2,V=3] 
* Loop 7: g(V,Out)->  g(V',Out)
                  [V'=3,V=2] 
* Loop 8: g(V,Out) [V>=1,V=Out+1]

### Ranking functions of CR g(V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR g(V,Out) 
* Partial RF of phase [6,7]:
  - RF of loop [6:1]:
    V-2 depends on loops [7:1]

* [[9],[9,[6,7]]] --> 1 
* [[8]] --> 2 
* [[8,[6,7]]] --> 3

### Specialization of cost equations start/1 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [11,12,13,14] 


#### Refined cost equations start/1

     [V>=0,W=0] 
* CE 12: start(V) = 0+ g(W,X):2
     [X>=0,X+1=W,X+1=V] 
* CE 13: start(V) = 0+ g(V,W):3
     [W>=1,V>=2,2>=W,3>=V] 
* CE 14: start(V) = 0+ g(V,W):4
     [V>=2,3>=V] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1
