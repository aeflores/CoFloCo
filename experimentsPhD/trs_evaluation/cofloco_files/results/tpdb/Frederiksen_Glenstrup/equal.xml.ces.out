Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations equal0/2 
* CE 6 is refined into CE [7] 
* CE 5 is refined into CE [8] 


#### Refined cost equations equal0/2

     [Out=42,V=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of equal0/2 
* CEs [8] --> Loop 4 
* CEs [7] --> Loop 5 

#### Loops of equal0/2

     [X=42,W=0,V=0] 
* CE 13: start(V) = 1+ equal0(V,W):2
     [V>=1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [10,13] --> Loop 6 
* CEs [9,11,12] --> Loop 7 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=1]
