Preprocessing Cost Relations
=====================================

#### Computed strongly connected components 
0. recursive  : [letexp/3]
1. non_recursive  : [goal/3]
2. non_recursive  : [start/2]

#### Obtained direct recursion through partial evaluation 
0. SCC is partially evaluated into letexp/3
1. SCC is completely evaluated into other SCCs
2. SCC is partially evaluated into start/2

Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations letexp/3 
* CE 4 is refined into CE [5] 


#### Refined cost equations letexp/3 
* CE 5: letexp(V1,V,Out) = 1+ letexp(W1,V,Out)
     [V>=0,V1>=0,V1+2=W1] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of letexp/3 
* CEs [5] --> Loop 3 

#### Loops of letexp/3 
* Loop 3: letexp(V1,V,Out)->  letexp(V1',V,Out)
                  [V>=0,V1>=0,V1+2=V1'] 

### Ranking functions of CR letexp(V1,V,Out) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR letexp(V1,V,Out) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:letexp(V1,V,Out) 
* [[3]]...


### Merging Chains  letexp/3 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[[3]]] --> 1 


### Specialization of cost equations start/2 
* CE 2 is refined into CE [6] 
* CE 3 is refined into CE [7] 


#### Refined cost equations start/2 
* CE 6: start(V1,V) = 0+ letexp(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0] 
* CE 7: start(V1,V) = 1+ letexp(V1,V,W1):1
     [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/2 
* CEs [6,7] --> Loop 4 

#### Loops of start/2 
* Loop 4: start(V1,V) [V>=0,V1>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V1,V) 

Warning: no base case found for predicate

### Resulting Chains:start(V1,V) 
* [4]...


### Merging Chains  start/2 into  External patterns of execution 
* [[4]] --> 1 


Computing Bounds
=====================================

#### Cost of loops [3] 

 * loop 3:letexp(V1,V,Out) -> [letexp(V1',V',Out')] 
1
#### Cost of phase [3]:letexp(V1,V,Out) -> [letexp(V1',V',Out')] 
1*it(3)+0
#### Cost of chains of letexp(V1,V,Out):
* Chain [[3]]...: 1*it(3)+0
  with precondition: [V1>=0,V>=0] 


#### Cost of chains of start(V1,V):
* Chain [4]...: 1*aux(1)+0
  with precondition: [V1>=0,V>=0] 


Closed-form bounds of start(V1,V): 
-------------------------------------
* Chain [4]... with precondition: [V1>=0,V>=0] 
    - Upper bound: inf 
    - Complexity: infinity 

### Maximum cost of start(V1,V): inf
