Control-Flow Refinement of Cost Relations
=====================================

### Specialization of cost equations decrease/2

     [X=42,W=0,V=0] 
* CE 13: start(V) = 1+ decrease(V,W):2
     [V>=1,W=42] 

### Cost equations --> "Loop" of start/1 
* CEs [9,10,11,12,13] --> Loop 6 

#### Loops of start/1 
* Loop 6: start(V) [V>=0] 

### Ranking functions of CR start(V) 

#### Partial ranking functions of CR start(V)
