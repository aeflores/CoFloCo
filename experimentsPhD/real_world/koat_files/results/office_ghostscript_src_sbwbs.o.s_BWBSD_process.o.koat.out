Slicing away variables that do not contribute to conditions from problem 1 leaves variables [v_j.0, v_j.1].

Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 5 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_s_BWBSD_process_bb2_in: X_1 >= 0
  For symbol eval_s_BWBSD_process_bb4_in: X_2 >= 0 /\ X_1 + X_2 - 4 >= 0 /\ X_1 - 4 >= 0


This yielded the following problem:
