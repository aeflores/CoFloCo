Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb6_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb6_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb6_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_stop()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

By chaining the transition eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_gx_path_release_bb0_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

By chaining the transition eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 6 produces the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

By chaining the transition eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_2() with all transitions in problem 7, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
We thus obtain the following problem:
8:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(?, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 8 produces the following problem:
9:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_gx_path_release_3() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_2() -> eval_gx_path_release_3()
		(1, 1)    eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in() -> eval_gx_path_release_2()
		(1, 2)    eval_gx_path_release_start() -> eval_gx_path_release_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_gx_path_release_start
	leaf cost:	3
