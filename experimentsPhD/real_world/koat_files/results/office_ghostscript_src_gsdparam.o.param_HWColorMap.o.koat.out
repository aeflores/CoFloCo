By chaining the transition eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb4_in(v_5, v_j.0) with all transitions in problem 15, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
16:	T:
		(1, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
		(?, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0) [ v_j.0 >= v_5 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0 + 1) [ v_j.0 < v_5 ]
		(1, 3)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb4_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
		(1, 2)    eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(nondef.1, v_j.0)
	start location:	eval_param_HWColorMap_start
	leaf cost:	4

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 16:
	eval_param_HWColorMap_bb4_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
17:	T:
		(?, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0) [ v_j.0 >= v_5 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0 + 1) [ v_j.0 < v_5 ]
		(1, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
		(1, 2)    eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(nondef.1, v_j.0)
	start location:	eval_param_HWColorMap_start
	leaf cost:	4

By chaining the transition eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(nondef.1, v_j.0) with all transitions in problem 17, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
18:	T:
		(1, 6)    eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 0)

		(?, 1)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0 + 1) [ v_j.0 < v_5 ]
		(1, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
	start location:	eval_param_HWColorMap_start
	leaf cost:	4

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 18:
	eval_param_HWColorMap_bb3_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
19:	T:
		(?, 4)    eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(v_5, 0) [ v_j.0 >= v_5 ]

	start location:	eval_param_HWColorMap_start
	leaf cost:	4

By chaining the transition eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 0) with all transitions in problem 19, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 0) [ 0 >= nondef.1 ]
	eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 1) [ 0 < nondef.1 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
20:	T:
		(1, 10)    eval_param_HWColorMap_start(v_5, v_j.0) -> eval_param_HWColorMap_bb6_in(nondef.1, 0) [ 0 >= nondef.1 ]
