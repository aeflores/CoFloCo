	start location:	eval_s_hex_process_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_start(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)

		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)

		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
	start location:	eval_s_hex_process_start
	leaf cost:	16

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_start(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
	start location:	eval_s_hex_process_start
	leaf cost:	16

By chaining the transition eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_start(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
	start location:	eval_s_hex_process_start
	leaf cost:	16

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_s_hex_process_bb5_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 2)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb6_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb10_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb2_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb18_in(v_syntax)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_hex_process_start(v_syntax) -> eval_s_hex_process_bb0_in(v_syntax)
	start location:	eval_s_hex_process_start
	leaf cost:	16
