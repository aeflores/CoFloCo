	start location:	eval_gs_heap_free_object_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_gs_heap_free_object_start() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb0_in()) with all transitions in problem 21, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_gs_heap_free_object_start() -> Com_2(eval_fprintf_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_11())
	eval_gs_heap_free_object_start() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb4_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
22:	T:
		(1, 4)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_start() -> Com_2(eval_fprintf_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_11())
		(1, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_start() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb4_in())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_34() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_stop())
		(7, 1)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_33() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_34())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_31() -> Com_2(eval_fprintf_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_33())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_29() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_stop())
		(3, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_20() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_stop())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb7_in() -> Com_2(eval_lprintf_file_and_line_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_31())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb7_in() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_29())
		(?, 1)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb7_in() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb7_in())
		(2, 1)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_11() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb4_in())
		(3, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb4_in() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_20())

	start location:	eval_gs_heap_free_object_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transitions from problem 22:
	eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb0_in() -> Com_2(eval_fprintf_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_11())
	eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_bb4_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
23:	T:
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_34() -> Com_1(eval_gs_heap_free_object_stop())
		(7, 1)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_33() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_34())
		(7, 2)    eval_gs_heap_free_object_31() -> Com_2(eval_fprintf_start(), eval_gs_heap_free_object_33())
