By chaining the transition eval_copyline_start(v_0) -> Com_1(eval_copyline_bb0_in(v_0)) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_copyline_start(v_0) -> Com_1(eval_copyline_bb1_in(v_0))
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_copyline_start(v_0) -> Com_1(eval_copyline_bb1_in(v_0))

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_copyline_bb0_in(v_0) -> Com_1(eval_copyline_bb1_in(v_0))
We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_copyline_NewDefault_in(v_0) -> Com_1(eval_copyline_4(v_0)) with all transitions in problem 8, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_copyline_NewDefault_in(v_0) -> Com_2(eval__IO_putc_start(v_0), eval_copyline_5(v_0))
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 9:

We thus obtain the following problem:
