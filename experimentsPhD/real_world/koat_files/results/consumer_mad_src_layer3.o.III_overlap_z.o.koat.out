Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_start(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb)
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(0, v_sb)
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_sb) [ v_i.0 < 18 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_stop(v_i.0, v_sb) [ v_i.0 >= 18 ]
	start location:	eval_III_overlap_z_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_start(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb)
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(0, v_sb)
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_sb) [ v_i.0 < 18 ]
	start location:	eval_III_overlap_z_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_start(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb)
		(1, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(0, v_sb)
		(?, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_sb) [ v_i.0 < 18 ]
	start location:	eval_III_overlap_z_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_III_overlap_z_start) = 18
	Pol(eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in) = 18
	Pol(eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 18
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_sb) [ v_i.0 < 18 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)     eval_III_overlap_z_start(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb)
		(1, 1)     eval_III_overlap_z_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(0, v_sb)
		(18, 1)    eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_sb) -> eval_III_overlap_z_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_sb) [ v_i.0 < 18 ]
	start location:	eval_III_overlap_z_start
	leaf cost:	1
