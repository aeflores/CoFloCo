Slicing away variables that do not contribute to conditions from problem 1 leaves variables [].
We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_pbm_print_row_20() -> Com_1(eval_pbm_print_row_bb6_in()) with all transitions in problem 4, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_pbm_print_row_20() -> Com_1(eval_pbm_print_row_bb3_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
