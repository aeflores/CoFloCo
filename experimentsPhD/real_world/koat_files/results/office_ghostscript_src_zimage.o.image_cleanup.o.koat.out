Initial complexity problem:

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_start) = 4
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_bb0_in) = 4
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_bb1_in) = 4
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_5) = 4
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_bb4_in) = 4
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_7) = 3
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_6) = 4
	Pol(eval_gs_image_cleanup_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_8) = 2
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_9) = 1
	Pol(eval_image_cleanup_stop) = 0
orients all transitions weakly and the transitions
	eval_image_cleanup_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_image_cleanup_7())
	eval_image_cleanup_9() -> Com_1(eval_image_cleanup_stop())
	eval_image_cleanup_8() -> Com_1(eval_image_cleanup_9())
	eval_image_cleanup_7() -> Com_2(eval_gs_image_cleanup_start(), eval_image_cleanup_8())
