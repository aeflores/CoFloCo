Slicing away variables that do not contribute to conditions from problem 1 leaves variables [].
We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_s_PSSE_process_bb18_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_bb21_in()) with all transitions in problem 4, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_PSSE_process_bb18_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 5:

We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_NewDefault_in()) with all transitions in problem 27, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in())
	eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())
We thus obtain the following problem:
28:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in())
		(?, 4)    eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transitions from problem 28:
	eval_s_PSSE_process_NewDefault_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in())
	eval_s_PSSE_process_NewDefault_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())
We thus obtain the following problem:
29:	T:

		(1, 4)    eval_s_PSSE_process_9() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_s_PSSE_process_9) = 1
	Pol(eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop) = 0
	Pol(eval_strchr_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_s_PSSE_process_start) = 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_s_PSSE_process_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_s_PSSE_process_stop())
strictly and produces the following problem:
