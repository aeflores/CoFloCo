Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v) [ nondef.6 - nondef.7 = 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v) [ nondef.6 - nondef.7 > 0 /\ nondef.8 >= 0 /\ nondef.6 - nondef.7 - 32*nondef.8 >= 0 /\ nondef.6 - nondef.7 - 32*nondef.8 < 32 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v) [ nondef.6 - nondef.7 < 0 /\ nondef.8 <= 0 /\ -nondef.6 + nondef.7 + 32*nondef.8 >= 0 /\ -nondef.6 + nondef.7 + 32*nondef.8 < 32 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb7_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_stop(v_v)
	start location:	eval_search_hints_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
	start location:	eval_search_hints_start
	leaf cost:	6

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v)
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
	start location:	eval_search_hints_start
	leaf cost:	6

By chaining the transition eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
	start location:	eval_search_hints_start
	leaf cost:	6

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_search_hints_bb0_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(1, 1)    eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb3_in(v_v)
		(1, 2)    eval_search_hints_start(v_v) -> eval_search_hints_bb2_in(v_v)
	start location:	eval_search_hints_start
	leaf cost:	6
