Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb14_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb14_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb14_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb14_in() -> eval_whatcap_stop()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	4

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb0_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	4

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_whatcap_start) = 4
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb0_in) = 4
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb1_in) = 4
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb4_in) = 3
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb5_in) = 2
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb8_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_whatcap_bb11_in) = 0
orients all transitions weakly and the transitions
	eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
	eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
	eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
	eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb0_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	4

By chaining the transition eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb0_in() with all transitions in problem 4, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	4

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 5:
	eval_whatcap_bb0_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb11_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb8_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb5_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb8_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb4_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb5_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
		(4, 1)    eval_whatcap_bb1_in() -> eval_whatcap_bb4_in()
		(1, 2)    eval_whatcap_start() -> eval_whatcap_bb1_in()
	start location:	eval_whatcap_start
	leaf cost:	4
