By chaining the transition eval_write_side_info_23() -> Com_1(eval_write_side_info_bb6_in()) with all transitions in problem 28, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_write_side_info_23() -> Com_2(eval_writePartSideInfo_start(), eval_write_side_info_23())
	eval_write_side_info_23() -> Com_1(eval_write_side_info_bb4_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
