Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb5_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb5_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb5_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_stop(v_rsize)
	start location:	eval_dict_round_size_large_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
	start location:	eval_dict_round_size_large_start
	leaf cost:	3

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize)
		(1, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
	start location:	eval_dict_round_size_large_start
	leaf cost:	3

By chaining the transition eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(1, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
	start location:	eval_dict_round_size_large_start
	leaf cost:	3

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_dict_round_size_large_bb0_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
		(1, 2)    eval_dict_round_size_large_start(v_rsize) -> eval_dict_round_size_large_bb2_in(v_rsize)
	start location:	eval_dict_round_size_large_start
	leaf cost:	3
