Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_stop(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_bb0_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 6 produces the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last)
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) with all transitions in problem 7, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
8:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)

		(1, 1)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
		(1, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 8:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_bb3_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
9:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)

	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) with all transitions in problem 9, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_start(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
10:	T:

	start location:	eval_s_MTFE_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 10:
	eval_s_MTFE_process_bb2_in(v_29, v_last) -> eval_s_MTFE_process_bb5_in(nondef.4, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
11:	T:
