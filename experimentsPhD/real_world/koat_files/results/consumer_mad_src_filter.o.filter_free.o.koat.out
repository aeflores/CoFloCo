Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb0_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb0_in())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_filter_free_start) = 1
	Pol(eval_filter_free_bb0_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_filter_free_bb1_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_filter_free_3) = 1
	Pol(eval_filter_free_stop) = 0
	Pol(eval_free_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_filter_free_4) = 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb0_in())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb0_in()) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_filter_free_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3())
		(1, 2)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_3()) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(1, 2)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 6:
	eval_filter_free_3() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
We thus obtain the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_4() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(?, 2)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_2(eval_free_start(), eval_filter_free_4())
		(1, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_stop())
		(?, 1)    eval_filter_free_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
		(1, 2)    eval_filter_free_start() -> Com_1(eval_filter_free_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_filter_free_start
	leaf cost:	0
