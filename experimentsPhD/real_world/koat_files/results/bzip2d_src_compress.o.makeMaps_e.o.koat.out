Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_makeMaps_e_start) = 256
	Pol(eval_makeMaps_e_bb0_in) = 256
	Pol(eval_makeMaps_e_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 256
	Pol(eval_makeMaps_e_bb4_in) = -V_1 + 255
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_makeMaps_e_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_makeMaps_e_bb4_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 256 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 4 produces the following problem:
