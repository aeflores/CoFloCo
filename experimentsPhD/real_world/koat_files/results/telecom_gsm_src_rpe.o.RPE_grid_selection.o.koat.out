Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_start(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 <= 12 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_stop(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 > 12 ]
	start location:	eval_RPE_grid_selection_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_start(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 <= 12 ]
	start location:	eval_RPE_grid_selection_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_start(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 <= 12 ]
	start location:	eval_RPE_grid_selection_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_RPE_grid_selection_start) = 13
	Pol(eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in) = 13
	Pol(eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 13
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 <= 12 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)     eval_RPE_grid_selection_start(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)     eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(0)
		(13, 1)    eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_RPE_grid_selection_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 <= 12 ]
	start location:	eval_RPE_grid_selection_start
	leaf cost:	1
