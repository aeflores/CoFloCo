By chaining the transition eval_Short_term_analysis_filtering_bb1_in(v_.0, v_2, v_i.0, v_k_n) -> eval_Short_term_analysis_filtering_bb3_in(v_.0, v_.0 - 1, 2, v_k_n) [ v_.0 < 0 /\ 0 < 8 /\ 1 < 8 ] with all transitions in problem 21, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_Short_term_analysis_filtering_bb1_in(v_.0, v_2, v_i.0, v_k_n) -> eval_Short_term_analysis_filtering_bb3_in(v_.0, v_.0 - 1, 3, v_k_n) [ v_.0 < 0 /\ 0 < 8 /\ 1 < 8 /\ 2 < 8 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
