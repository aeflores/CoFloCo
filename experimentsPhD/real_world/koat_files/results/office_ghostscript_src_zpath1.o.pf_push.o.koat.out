A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_pf_push_start) = V_2
	Pol(eval_pf_push_bb0_in) = V_2
	Pol(eval_pf_push_bb1_in) = V_1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_pf_push_bb1_in(v_.01, v_n) -> eval_pf_push_bb1_in(v_.01 - 1, v_n) [ v_.01 > 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:

Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 4 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_pf_push_bb1_in: -X_1 + X_2 >= 0


This yielded the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_pf_push_start(v_.01, v_n) -> eval_pf_push_bb0_in(v_.01, v_n) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_pf_push_start(v_.01, v_n) -> eval_pf_push_bb1_in(v_n, v_n)
We thus obtain the following problem:
