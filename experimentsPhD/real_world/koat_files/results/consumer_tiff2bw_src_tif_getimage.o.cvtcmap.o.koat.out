Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)
		(?, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1) [ v_i.0 >= 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_stop(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 0 ]
	start location:	eval_cvtcmap_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)

	start location:	eval_cvtcmap_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)
		(?, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1) [ v_i.0 >= 0 ]
	start location:	eval_cvtcmap_start

By chaining the transition eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_cvtcmap_start(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)
		(1, 1)    eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)

	start location:	eval_cvtcmap_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_cvtcmap_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_cvtcmap_bb1_in(nondef.1 - 1)
