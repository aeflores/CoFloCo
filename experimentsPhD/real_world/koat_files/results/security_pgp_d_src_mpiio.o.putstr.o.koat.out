Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_putstr_start) = 1
	Pol(eval_putstr_bb0_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_putstr_bb1_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_putstr_4) = 1
	Pol(eval_putstr_stop) = 0
	Pol(eval_putchar_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_putstr_5) = 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4)) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_putstr_bb0_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))

		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1))
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_4(nondef.1)) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))

		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 6:
	eval_putstr_4(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(v_4), eval_putstr_5(v_4))
We thus obtain the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
		(?, 2)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4)) with all transitions in problem 7, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
	eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
We thus obtain the following problem:
8:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
		(?, 2)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(?, 2)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))

		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 8 produces the following problem:
9:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
		(?, 2)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))

		(1, 1)    eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_putstr_5) = 1
	Pol(eval_putchar_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_putstr_stop) = 0
	Pol(eval_putstr_bb1_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_putstr_start) = 1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
strictly and produces the following problem:
10:	T:
		(?, 3)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_5(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))

		(1, 2)    eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4))
	start location:	eval_putstr_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_bb1_in(v_4)) with all transitions in problem 10, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_2(eval_putchar_start(nondef.1), eval_putstr_5(nondef.1))
	eval_putstr_start(v_4) -> Com_1(eval_putstr_stop(v_4))
We thus obtain the following problem:
