Slicing away variables that do not contribute to conditions from problem 1 leaves variables [v_12].
We thus obtain the following problem:

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_combinecaps_29(v_12) -> Com_1(eval_combinecaps_40(v_12)) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
