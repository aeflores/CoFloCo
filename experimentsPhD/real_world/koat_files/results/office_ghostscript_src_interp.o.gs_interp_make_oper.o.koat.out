Initial complexity problem:

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_idx)

		(?, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1, v_idx) [ v_i.0 - 1 >= 0 ]
	start location:	eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start
	leaf cost:	4

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_idx)
		(1, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(10, v_idx)
		(?, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1, v_idx) [ v_i.0 - 1 >= 0 ]
	start location:	eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start
	leaf cost:	4

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start) = 10
	Pol(eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in) = 10
	Pol(eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in) = V_1
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1, v_idx) [ v_i.0 - 1 >= 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)     eval_gs_interp_make_oper_start(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_idx)
		(1, 1)     eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(10, v_idx)
		(10, 1)    eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_idx) -> eval_gs_interp_make_oper_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1, v_idx) [ v_i.0 - 1 >= 0 ]
