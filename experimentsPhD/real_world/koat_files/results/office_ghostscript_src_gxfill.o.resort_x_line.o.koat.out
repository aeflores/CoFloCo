Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb11_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb11_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_stop()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2

By chaining the transition eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_resort_x_line_bb0_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(1, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2

By chaining the transition eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(?, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(1, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 6 produces the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb7_in()
		(1, 1)    eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb3_in()
		(1, 2)    eval_resort_x_line_start() -> eval_resort_x_line_bb2_in()
	start location:	eval_resort_x_line_start
	leaf cost:	2
