Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 > 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_stop(v_count.1, v_last) [ v_count.1 = 0 ]
	start location:	eval_s_BT_process_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last)

		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 > 0 ]
	start location:	eval_s_BT_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1, v_last)
		(1, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 > 0 ]
	start location:	eval_s_BT_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)
	eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)

		(?, 1)    eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(v_count.1 - 1, v_last) [ v_count.1 > 0 ]
	start location:	eval_s_BT_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transitions from problem 4:
	eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1, v_last)
	eval_s_BT_process_bb0_in(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:

		(1, 2)    eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.2 - nondef.3, v_last)
	start location:	eval_s_BT_process_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1, v_last) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1 - 1, v_last) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 > 0 ]

We thus obtain the following problem:

	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_s_BT_process_start(v_count.1, v_last) -> eval_s_BT_process_bb1_in(nondef.0 - nondef.1 - 1, v_last) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 > 0 ] with all transitions in problem 6, the following new transition is obtained:
