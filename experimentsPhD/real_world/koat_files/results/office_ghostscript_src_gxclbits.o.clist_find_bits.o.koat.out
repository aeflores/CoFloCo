MAYBE

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb6_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb6_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_stop(v_id)
	start location:	eval_clist_find_bits_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
	start location:	eval_clist_find_bits_start
	leaf cost:	2

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id)
		(1, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
	start location:	eval_clist_find_bits_start
	leaf cost:	2

By chaining the transition eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(1, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
	start location:	eval_clist_find_bits_start
	leaf cost:	2

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_clist_find_bits_bb0_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
		(1, 2)    eval_clist_find_bits_start(v_id) -> eval_clist_find_bits_bb1_in(v_id)
	start location:	eval_clist_find_bits_start
	leaf cost:	2
