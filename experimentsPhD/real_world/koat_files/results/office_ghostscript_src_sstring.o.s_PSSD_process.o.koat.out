By chaining the transition eval_s_PSSD_process_start(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb0_in(v_last) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_PSSD_process_start(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_s_PSSD_process_bb0_in(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb14_in(v_last) with all transitions in problem 22, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 23:
	eval_s_PSSD_process_bb14_in(v_last) -> eval_s_PSSD_process_bb1_in(v_last)
We thus obtain the following problem:
