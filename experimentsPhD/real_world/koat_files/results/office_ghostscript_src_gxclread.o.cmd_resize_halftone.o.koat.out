Slicing away variables that do not contribute to conditions from problem 1 leaves variables [v_12, v_i.0, v_num_comp].
We thus obtain the following problem:

Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 4 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_cmd_resize_halftone_10: X_2 - X_3 - 1 >= 0 /\ X_1 - X_3 >= 0 /\ X_1 - X_2 + 1 >= 0 /\ -X_1 + X_2 - 1 >= 0
  For symbol eval_cmd_resize_halftone_11: X_2 - X_3 - 1 >= 0 /\ X_1 - X_3 >= 0 /\ X_1 - X_2 + 1 >= 0 /\ -X_1 + X_2 - 1 >= 0
  For symbol eval_cmd_resize_halftone_12: -X_2 + X_3 >= 0
  For symbol eval_cmd_resize_halftone_13: -X_2 + X_3 >= 0
  For symbol eval_cmd_resize_halftone_14: -X_2 + X_3 >= 0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 28:
	eval_cmd_resize_halftone_19(v_12, v_i.0, v_num_comp) -> Com_1(eval_cmd_resize_halftone_bb13_in(v_12, v_i.0, v_num_comp))
We thus obtain the following problem:
