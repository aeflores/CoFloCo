Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:

Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 3 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_PascalToC_bb1_in: X_2 >= 0


This yielded the following problem:
