orients all transitions weakly and the transition

By chaining the transition eval_save_set_new_start(v_to_new) -> Com_1(eval_save_set_new_bb0_in(v_to_new)) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_save_set_new_start(v_to_new) -> Com_1(eval_save_set_new_0(v_to_new))
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_save_set_new_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> Com_1(eval_save_set_new_0(v_to_new))
We thus obtain the following problem:

By chaining the transition eval_save_set_new_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> Com_1(eval_save_set_new_bb14_in(v_to_new)) with all transitions in problem 8, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_save_set_new_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> Com_1(eval_save_set_new_bb4_in(v_to_new))
We thus obtain the following problem:
