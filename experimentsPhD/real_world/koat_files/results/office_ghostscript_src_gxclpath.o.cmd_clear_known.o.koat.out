By chaining the transition eval_cmd_clear_known_start(v_i.0, v_known) -> eval_cmd_clear_known_bb1_in(nondef.0 - 13, v_known) [ nondef.0 - 1 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 2 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 3 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 4 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 5 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 6 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 7 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 8 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 9 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 10 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 11 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 12 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 13 >= 0 ] with all transitions in problem 18, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_cmd_clear_known_start(v_i.0, v_known) -> eval_cmd_clear_known_bb1_in(nondef.0 - 14, v_known) [ nondef.0 - 1 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 2 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 3 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 4 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 5 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 6 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 7 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 8 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 9 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 10 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 11 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 12 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 13 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 14 >= 0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
19:	T:
		(1, 16)    eval_cmd_clear_known_start(v_i.0, v_known) -> eval_cmd_clear_known_bb1_in(nondef.0 - 14, v_known) [ nondef.0 - 1 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 2 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 3 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 4 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 5 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 6 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 7 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 8 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 9 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 10 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 11 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 12 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 13 >= 0 /\ nondef.0 - 14 >= 0 ]
		(?, 1)     eval_cmd_clear_known_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_known) -> eval_cmd_clear_known_bb1_in(v_i.0 - 1, v_known) [ v_i.0 - 1 >= 0 ]
