Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 7 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_id3_ucs4_putnumber_bb3_in: -X_1 + 9 >= 0 /\ X_1 + 9 >= 0


This yielded the following problem:
8:	T:

By chaining the transition eval_id3_ucs4_putnumber_bb1_in(v_.01, v_number) -> eval_id3_ucs4_putnumber_bb3_in(v_.01, v_number) [ v_.01 < 0 /\ nondef.0 <= 0 /\ nondef.0 > -10 /\ nondef.1 <= 0 /\ -v_.01 + 10*nondef.1 >= 0 /\ -v_.01 + 10*nondef.1 < 10 /\ nondef.1 = 0 ] with all transitions in problem 8, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_id3_ucs4_putnumber_bb1_in(v_.01, v_number) -> eval_id3_ucs4_putnumber_bb3_in(v_.01, v_number) [ v_.01 < 0 /\ nondef.0 <= 0 /\ nondef.0 > -10 /\ nondef.1 <= 0 /\ -v_.01 + 10*nondef.1 >= 0 /\ -v_.01 + 10*nondef.1 < 10 /\ nondef.1 = 0 /\ -v_.01 + 9 >= 0 /\ v_.01 + 9 >= 0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
