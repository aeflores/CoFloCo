YES(?, v_num_bytes + 3)

Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes)
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(0, v_num_bytes)
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 < v_num_bytes ]
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_stop(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 >= v_num_bytes ]
	start location:	eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes)
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(0, v_num_bytes)
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 < v_num_bytes ]
	start location:	eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes)
		(1, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(0, v_num_bytes)
		(?, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 < v_num_bytes ]
	start location:	eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start) = V_2
	Pol(eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in) = V_2
	Pol(eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in) = -V_1 + V_2
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 < v_num_bytes ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)              eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes)
		(1, 1)              eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb0_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(0, v_num_bytes)
		(v_num_bytes, 1)    eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0, v_num_bytes) -> eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1, v_num_bytes) [ v_i.0 < v_num_bytes ]
	start location:	eval_hc_sizes_from_bytes_start
	leaf cost:	1
