By chaining the transition eval_ref_stack_pop_bb1_in(v_.0, v_13, v_count) -> Com_1(eval_ref_stack_pop_8(v_.0, v_.0 - nondef.2, v_count)) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 = 0 /\ nondef.2 = 0 /\ nondef.2 < v_.0 ] with all transitions in problem 7, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_ref_stack_pop_bb1_in(v_.0, v_13, v_count) -> Com_2(eval_ref_stack_pop_block_start(v_.0, v_.0 - nondef.2, v_count), eval_ref_stack_pop_9(v_.0, v_.0 - nondef.2, v_count)) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 = 0 /\ nondef.2 = 0 /\ nondef.2 < v_.0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 8:
