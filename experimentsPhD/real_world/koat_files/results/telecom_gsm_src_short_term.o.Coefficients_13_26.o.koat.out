Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_start(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(1)
		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 <= 8 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_stop(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 > 8 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_Coefficients_13_26_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_start(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(1)

		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_Coefficients_13_26_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_start(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0)

		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_Coefficients_13_26_start

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_Coefficients_13_26_start) = 8
	Pol(eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in) = 8
	Pol(eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 9
	Pol(eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in) = -V_1 + 8
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 <= 8 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_start(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb0_in(v_i.0)

		(?, 1)    eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb4_in(v_i.0) -> eval_Coefficients_13_26_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_Coefficients_13_26_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 4 produces the following problem:
5:	T:
