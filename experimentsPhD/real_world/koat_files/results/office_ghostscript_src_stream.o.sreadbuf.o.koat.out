orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_stop())

By chaining the transition eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb0_in()) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_sreadbuf_bb0_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:

		(1, 3)    eval_sreadbuf_bb4_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(1, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_sreadbuf_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 26:
	eval_sreadbuf_bb4_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
We thus obtain the following problem:
27:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_13() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in())
		(?, 5)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(1, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_stop())
		(?, 5)    eval_sreadbuf_23() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(?, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in() -> Com_2(eval_sclose_start(), eval_sreadbuf_13())
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in())
		(?, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_8() -> Com_2(eval_stream_compact_start(), eval_sreadbuf_23())
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_8() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in())
		(1, 4)    eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(1, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in())
	start location:	eval_sreadbuf_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in()) with all transitions in problem 27, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
We thus obtain the following problem:
28:	T:
		(1, 6)    eval_sreadbuf_start() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_13() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in())
		(?, 5)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(1, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_stop())
		(?, 5)    eval_sreadbuf_23() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(?, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in() -> Com_2(eval_sclose_start(), eval_sreadbuf_13())
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in())
		(?, 2)    eval_sreadbuf_8() -> Com_2(eval_stream_compact_start(), eval_sreadbuf_23())
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_8() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb8_in())
		(1, 4)    eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
	start location:	eval_sreadbuf_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 28:
	eval_sreadbuf_bb1_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
We thus obtain the following problem:
29:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_13() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in())
		(?, 5)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_8())
		(1, 1)    eval_sreadbuf_bb11_in() -> Com_1(eval_sreadbuf_stop())

	start location:	eval_sreadbuf_start
	leaf cost:	0
