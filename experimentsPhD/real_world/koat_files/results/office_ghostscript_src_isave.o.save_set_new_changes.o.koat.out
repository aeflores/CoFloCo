Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_stop(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_save_set_new_changes_bb0_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(?, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 6 produces the following problem:
7:	T:
		(?, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 1)    eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb4_in(v_to_new)
		(1, 2)    eval_save_set_new_changes_start(v_to_new) -> eval_save_set_new_changes_bb1_in(v_to_new)
	start location:	eval_save_set_new_changes_start
	leaf cost:	1
