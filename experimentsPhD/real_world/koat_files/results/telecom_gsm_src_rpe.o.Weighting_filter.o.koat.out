Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:

	start location:	eval_Weighting_filter_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_Weighting_filter_start) = 40
	Pol(eval_Weighting_filter_bb0_in) = 40
	Pol(eval_Weighting_filter_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 40
	Pol(eval_Weighting_filter_bb4_in) = -V_1 + 39
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_Weighting_filter_bb1_in(v_k.0) -> eval_Weighting_filter_bb4_in(v_k.0) [ v_k.0 <= 39 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)     eval_Weighting_filter_start(v_k.0) -> eval_Weighting_filter_bb0_in(v_k.0)
		(1, 1)     eval_Weighting_filter_bb0_in(v_k.0) -> eval_Weighting_filter_bb1_in(0)

	start location:	eval_Weighting_filter_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 4 produces the following problem:
5:	T:

		(1, 1)     eval_Weighting_filter_bb0_in(v_k.0) -> eval_Weighting_filter_bb1_in(0)
