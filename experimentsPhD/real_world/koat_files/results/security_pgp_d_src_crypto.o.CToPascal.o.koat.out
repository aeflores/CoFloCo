Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_i.0 = 0 ]
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_i.0 = 0 ]
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_start) = 1
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_0) = 1
	Pol(eval_string_length_start) = 0
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_1) = 1
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_CToPascal_stop) = 0
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_i.0 = 0 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_i.0 = 0 ]
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 3 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_CToPascal_bb1_in: X_1 - X_2 >= 0


This yielded the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 = 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0)) with all transitions in problem 4, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 = 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 5:
	eval_CToPascal_0(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 = 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(1, 2)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0))
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

By chaining the transition eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0)) with all transitions in problem 6, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
We thus obtain the following problem:
7:	T:
		(1, 3)    eval_CToPascal_start(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 > 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_stop(v_0, v_i.0)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 = 0 ]
		(1, 1)    eval_CToPascal_1(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_0))
		(1, 2)    eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
	start location:	eval_CToPascal_start
	leaf cost:	0

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 7:
	eval_CToPascal_bb0_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_2(eval_string_length_start(v_0, v_i.0), eval_CToPascal_1(nondef.0, v_i.0))
We thus obtain the following problem:
8:	T:
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 < 0 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0) -> Com_1(eval_CToPascal_bb1_in(v_0, v_i.0 - 1)) [ v_0 - v_i.0 >= 0 /\ v_i.0 > 0 ]
