Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0, v_w) [ v_.0 > 127 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_stop(v_.0, v_w) [ v_.0 <= 127 ]
	start location:	eval_cmd_size_w_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0, v_w) [ v_.0 > 127 ]
	start location:	eval_cmd_size_w_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w)
		(1, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0, v_w) [ v_.0 > 127 ]
	start location:	eval_cmd_size_w_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
		(1, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
		(?, 1)    eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0, v_w) [ v_.0 > 127 ]
	start location:	eval_cmd_size_w_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_cmd_size_w_bb0_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w)
We thus obtain the following problem:
5:	T:

By chaining the transition eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_w, v_w) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:

We thus obtain the following problem:
19:	T:
		(1, 16)    eval_cmd_size_w_start(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0''''''''''''', v_w) [ v_w > 127 /\ nondef.0 > 127 /\ nondef.0' > 127 /\ nondef.0'' > 127 /\ nondef.0''' > 127 /\ nondef.0'''' > 127 /\ nondef.0''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0'''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0''''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0'''''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0''''''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0'''''''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0''''''''''' > 127 /\ nondef.0'''''''''''' > 127 ]
		(?, 1)     eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(v_.0, v_w) -> eval_cmd_size_w_bb1_in(nondef.0, v_w) [ v_.0 > 127 ]
	start location:	eval_cmd_size_w_start
	leaf cost:	1

Complexity upper bound ?
