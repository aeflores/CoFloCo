By chaining the transition eval_count_to_stopped_bb0_in(v_count.0, v_mask, v_used.0) -> eval_count_to_stopped_bb2_in(nondef.2 - 7, v_mask, nondef.2) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 < 0 /\ nondef.2 <= 0 /\ -nondef.0 + nondef.1 + 16*nondef.2 >= 0 /\ -nondef.0 + nondef.1 + 16*nondef.2 < 16 /\ 0 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 < 0 /\ 1 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 1 < 0 /\ 2 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 2 < 0 /\ 3 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 3 < 0 /\ 4 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 4 < 0 /\ 5 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 5 < 0 /\ 6 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 6 < 0 ] with all transitions in problem 21, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_count_to_stopped_bb0_in(v_count.0, v_mask, v_used.0) -> eval_count_to_stopped_bb2_in(nondef.2 - 8, v_mask, nondef.2) [ nondef.0 - nondef.1 < 0 /\ nondef.2 <= 0 /\ -nondef.0 + nondef.1 + 16*nondef.2 >= 0 /\ -nondef.0 + nondef.1 + 16*nondef.2 < 16 /\ 0 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 < 0 /\ 1 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 1 < 0 /\ 2 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 2 < 0 /\ 3 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 3 < 0 /\ 4 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 4 < 0 /\ 5 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 5 < 0 /\ 6 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 6 < 0 /\ 7 >= 0 /\ nondef.2 - 7 < 0 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
