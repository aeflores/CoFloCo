Applied AI with 'oct' on problem 3 to obtain the following invariants:
  For symbol eval_setup_brightness_lut_4: -X_2 + 256 >= 0 /\ X_2 + 256 >= 0
  For symbol eval_setup_brightness_lut_5: -X_2 + 256 >= 0 /\ X_2 + 256 >= 0
  For symbol eval_setup_brightness_lut_bb1_in: X_2 + 256 >= 0
  For symbol eval_setup_brightness_lut_bb4_in: -X_2 + 256 >= 0 /\ X_2 + 256 >= 0
