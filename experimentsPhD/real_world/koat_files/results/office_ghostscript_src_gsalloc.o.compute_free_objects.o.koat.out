		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_stop(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 >= 201 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0)

		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)

		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_start) = 201
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in) = 201
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 201
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in) = -V_1 + 200
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
		(?, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in) = 1
	Pol(eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in) = 0
and size complexities
	S("eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)", 0-0) = ?
	S("eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)", 0-0) = ?
	S("eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]", 0-0) = ?
	S("eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)", 0-0) = 0
	S("eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0)", 0-0) = v_i.0
orients the transitions
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
weakly and the transition
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
strictly and produces the following problem:
5:	T:
		(1, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
		(?, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) with all transitions in problem 5, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
6:	T:
		(1, 2)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
		(1, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
		(?, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 6:
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
We thus obtain the following problem:
7:	T:
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1)

		(1, 2)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) with all transitions in problem 7, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 + 1 < 201 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
8:	T:
		(201, 2)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 + 1 < 201 ]

		(1, 2)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0)
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

By chaining the transition eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(0) with all transitions in problem 8, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(0) [ 0 < 201 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
9:	T:
		(1, 3)      eval_compute_free_objects_start(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(0) [ 0 < 201 ]
		(201, 2)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 + 1 < 201 ]
		(?, 1)      eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0)
		(201, 1)    eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
	start location:	eval_compute_free_objects_start
	leaf cost:	1

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 9:
	eval_compute_free_objects_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_compute_free_objects_bb3_in(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 < 201 ]
We thus obtain the following problem:
10:	T:
