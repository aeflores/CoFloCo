By chaining the transition eval_pre_process_context_30() -> Com_1(eval_pre_process_context_bb6_in()) with all transitions in problem 28, the following new transitions are obtained:
	eval_pre_process_context_30() -> Com_2(eval_jcopy_sample_rows_start(), eval_pre_process_context_30())
	eval_pre_process_context_30() -> Com_1(eval_pre_process_context_bb4_in())
We thus obtain the following problem:
