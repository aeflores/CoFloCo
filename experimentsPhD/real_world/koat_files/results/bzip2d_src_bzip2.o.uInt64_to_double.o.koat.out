Initial complexity problem:
1:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_start(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 < 8 ]
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_stop(v_i.0) [ v_i.0 >= 8 ]
	start location:	eval_uInt64_to_double_start
	leaf cost:	0

Repeatedly removing leaves of the complexity graph in problem 1 produces the following problem:
2:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_start(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 < 8 ]
	start location:	eval_uInt64_to_double_start
	leaf cost:	1

Repeatedly propagating knowledge in problem 2 produces the following problem:
3:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_start(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(0)
		(?, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 < 8 ]
	start location:	eval_uInt64_to_double_start
	leaf cost:	1

A polynomial rank function with
	Pol(eval_uInt64_to_double_start) = 8
	Pol(eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in) = 8
	Pol(eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in) = -V_1 + 8
orients all transitions weakly and the transition
	eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 < 8 ]
strictly and produces the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_start(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0)
		(1, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb0_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(0)
		(8, 1)    eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0) -> eval_uInt64_to_double_bb1_in(v_i.0 + 1) [ v_i.0 < 8 ]
	start location:	eval_uInt64_to_double_start
	leaf cost:	1
