By chaining the transition eval_swritebuf_start(v_last) -> Com_1(eval_swritebuf_bb0_in(v_last)) with all transitions in problem 3, the following new transition is obtained:
	eval_swritebuf_start(v_last) -> Com_1(eval_swritebuf_bb1_in(v_last))
We thus obtain the following problem:
4:	T:
		(1, 2)    eval_swritebuf_start(v_last) -> Com_1(eval_swritebuf_bb1_in(v_last))

Testing for reachability in the complexity graph removes the following transition from problem 4:
	eval_swritebuf_bb0_in(v_last) -> Com_1(eval_swritebuf_bb1_in(v_last))
We thus obtain the following problem:
