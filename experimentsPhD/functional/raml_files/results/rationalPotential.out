Analyzing function zip3 ...

  Trying degree: 1

== zip3 :

  ['a list; 'b list; 'c list] -> ('a * 'b * 'c) list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
      2.00  <--  ([::(*)], [], [])
      2.00  <--  ([], [::(*)], [])
     15.00  <--  ([], [], [::(*)])
      3.00  <--  ([], [], [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 2.00*L + 2.00*M + 15.00*Y
   where
     Y is the number of ::-nodes of the 3rd component of the argument
     L is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the argument
