Analyzing function mult ...

  Trying degree: 1

== mult :

  [int; int list] -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     15.00  <--  (*, [::(*)])
      3.00  <--  (*, [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 15.00*M
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
