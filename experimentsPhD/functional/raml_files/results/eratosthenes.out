Analyzing function filter ...

  Trying degree: 1

== filter :

  [int; int list] -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     23.00  <--  (*, [::(*)])
      3.00  <--  (*, [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 23.00*M
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument

Analyzing function eratos ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2

== eratos :

  int list -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     23.00  <--  [::(*); ::(*)]
     16.00  <--  [::(*)]

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 4.50*M + 11.50*M^2
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument
