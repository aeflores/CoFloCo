Analyzing function findMin ...

  Trying degree: 1

== findMin :

  int list -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     21.00  <--  [::(*)]
      3.00  <--  []

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 21.00*M
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument

--
  Mode:          upper

Analyzing function minSort ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2

== minSort :

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     21.00  <--  [::(*); ::(*)]
     36.00  <--  [::(*)]
      8.00  <--  []

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     8.00 + 25.50*M + 10.50*M^2
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument
