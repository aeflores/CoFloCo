Analyzing function msplit ...

  Trying degree: 1

== msplit :

  'a list -> 'a list * 'a list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
      9.50  <--  [::(*)]
      5.00  <--  []

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     5.00 + 9.50*M
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument

--
  Mode:          upper
  Metric:        steps
  Degree:        1
  Run time:      0.05 seconds
  #Constraints:  57

Analyzing function merge ...

  Trying degree: 1

== merge :

  [int list; int list] -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     22.00  <--  ([::(*)], [])
     22.00  <--  ([], [::(*)])
      3.00  <--  ([], [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 22.00*L + 22.00*M
   where
     L is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the argument

--
  Mode:          upper
  Metric:        steps
  Degree:        1
  Run time:      0.07 seconds
  #Constraints:  87

====

Analyzing function mergesortBuggy ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

  A bound for mergesortBuggy could not be derived. The linear program is infeasible.

--
  Mode:          upper
  Metric:        steps
  Degree:        6
  Run time:      31.88 seconds
  #Constraints:  57283

====

Analyzing function mergesort ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2

== mergesort :

  int list -> int list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     94.67  <--  [::(*); ::(*)]
      8.67  <--  [::(*)]
      3.00  <--  []

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 - 38.67*M + 47.33*M^2
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument

--
  Mode:          upper
  Metric:        steps
  Degree:        2
  Run time:      0.37 seconds
