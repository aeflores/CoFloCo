Analyzing function leq ...

  Trying degree: 1

== leq :

  [int list; int list] -> bool

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
      2.00  <--  ([::(*)], [])
     16.00  <--  ([], [::(*)])
      3.00  <--  ([], [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 + 16.00*L + 2.00*M
   where
     L is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the argument

Analyzing function insert ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2

== insert :

  [int list; int list list] -> int list list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:
     18.00  <--  ([::(*)], [::([])])
     19.00  <--  ([], [::([])])
      6.00  <--  ([], [])

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     6.00 + 19.00*L + 18.00*L*M
   where
     L is the number of ::-nodes of the 2nd component of the argument
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the 1st component of the argument

Analyzing function isortlist ...

  Trying degree: 1, 2, 3

== isortlist :

  int list list -> int list list

  Non-zero annotations of the argument:

     19.00  <--  [::([]); ::([])]
     16.00  <--  [::([])]
      3.00  <--  []

  Non-zero annotations of result:

  Simplified bound:
     3.00 - 9.00*L*M + 9.00*L*M^2 + 6.50*M + 9.50*M^2
   where
     M is the number of ::-nodes of the argument
     L is the maximal number of ::-nodes in the ::-nodes of the argument
